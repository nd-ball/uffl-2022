"6K7FXWG8","journalArticle","2012","Myers, Richard S","Reflections on the Twentieth Anniversary of Planned Parenthood v. Casey","","","","","","Regarded by Michael Paulsen as the worst constitutional decision of all time, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) was a momentous decision. The Court seemed poised to overrule Roe v. Wade. In the end, Justice Kennedy joined with Justices O’Connor and Souter to author the (in)famous joint opinion that upheld the essence of Roe v. Wade while abandoning some of Roe’s key features. Casey has generated a great deal of commentary and been influential in certain respects. On the twentieth anniversary of the decision, this paper examines the Casey decision and assesses its impact on the law of abortion, on the law of substantive due process, and on the role of stare decisis in constitutional litigation.","2012","2022-05-03 13:59:36","2022-05-26 13:37:28","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/VKRSDQHV/Myers - Reflections on the Twentieth Anniversary of Planne.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Politics of Abortion under a Majority Conservative Canadian Government","","","","","","Canada became one of the only countries in the world with no legal restrictions on abortion when its Supreme Court struck down its existing law in 1988. A very weak law against abortion was defeated by a tie vote of Canada’s Senate in 1990, opposed by opponents of abortion because of its weakness and by friends of abortion happy to have no law. In 2011 Canada’s Conservative party led by Stephen Harper obtained a parliamentary majority. The party included many MPs who wanted to see abortion restricted but its leader had promised to prevent any debate on abortion in the House. His political foes nevertheless accused Harper of having a hidden agenda. This essay explores the dilemma Harper faced as he tried to prevent the debate that many of his supporters wanted and the lessons that might be learned from that experience by Harper’s successor if and when he achieves power.","2012","2022-05-03 13:59:35","2022-05-26 13:38:17","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/CFW2LP78/Mathie - A Hidden Agenda The Politics of Abortion under a .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today’s abortion-rights arguments are parallel to nineteenth-century pro-slavery arguments. Those who said that slaves were not legal persons had to fail. Someday soon the tiny human beings who are not yet born will have protection as legal persons. Medical and technological advances will continue to roll back the frontiers of inner space in defining the genesis of human life.

The thesis of this paper is that contraception actually leads to more (not less) abortions. On the other hand, the use of natural family planning (NFP) and the acceptance of fertility lend themselves to an openness to life. The specific purpose of the paper is to describe the influence of contraceptive use and of NFP on the likelihood of having an abortion among women of reproductive age. The rate of those who at one time or another used any method of contraception coincides with the likelihood of ever having an abortion to a high degree. By contrast, those who at any time used NFP do not have any significant likelihood of ever having an abortion. From the data studied, it appears that contraception contributes to the likelihood of having an abortion and NFP prevents that likelihood. Promotion of the use of NFP among married couples and chastity among adolescents are ways of contributing to the culture of life.","2012","2022-05-03 13:59:31","2022-05-26 13:41:27","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/EJUIMMZP/Fehring - The Influence of Contraception on Abortion among W.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2PSEVDB6","journalArticle","2012","Bellinger, Charles K","René Girard and the History of Rights Language","","","","","","Rights language is an important aspect of contemporary American politics and cultural discussion. It is also very puzzling, for there is so little consensus concerning what rights language means. When advocates of widely differing, and perhaps opposing, social policies invoke rights language and believe that it decisively supports their cause, both the importance and the puzzling nature of rights are brought to the forefront of our consciousness. The abortion debate is a particularly clear example of this. I will refer to it from time to time below, even though this essay is not focused on abortion per se. I will outline some of the competing philosophical schools of thought on rights, with attention to their historical roots. I will then propose an approach to rights language that I find to be implied in the writings of French author René Girard, an approach that differs in significant ways from the various schools of thought. Girard’s reflections will lead to a reconsideration of a key figure in the history of political thought, John Locke. I will argue that Locke’s approach to rights fits well with Girard’s historical narrative. I seek to establish that the current disarray in the use of rights language could be reduced if more attention were paid to Girard’s suggestion that the purpose of rights language is to build a linguistic hedge around human beings to prevent them from being victimized.","2012","2022-05-03 13:59:28","2022-05-26 13:38:01","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/PZG8PN8T/Bellinger - René Girard and the History of Rights Language.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women who refuse abortion may be blamed for their choice by boyfriends, neighbors, employers, and others. Similarly, infirm or dying persons may find family and other caregivers upset by their refusal to agree to assisted suicide when voluntary death seems the sensible option. Finally, the author questions whether a life chosen as an option can ever have the dignity of a life simply accepted; that is, whether the child whom a mother once chose not to abort suffers from her having been able to choose otherwise, and whether the severely disabled but suiciderejecting person suffers from having to justify her continued existence.","2011","2022-05-03 13:59:26","2022-05-26 13:42:06","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/DWGVADJZ/Stith - Anti-Choice When Having a Choice Diminishes Famil.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DQLIXLER","journalArticle","2011","Manchester, Eric","Distinguishing Secular and Theological Justifications of the First Amendment: Implications for Pro-Life Legislation","","","","","","The contention of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that government may neither establish any religion nor prevent the free exercise of religion allows for these restrictions to be conceptually justified on either theological or secular terms. Consequently, there is no prima facie reason to insist that the enactment of laws, including those concerning “life issues,” cannot be motivated by particular religious convictions so long as the legislation does not mandate religion as such. This is even more evident when one considers that (1) any attempt to prohibit such influence would illicitly stipulate that one is not free to exercise one’s religious convictions in this way, and (2) that the coupling of clauses on religious liberty with further clauses in the Bill of Rights protecting free speech, assembly, and petition suggests a presumption that religious convictions will be able to play a role in the formation of public policy. Given this, I propose a principle of equitability whereby laws can reflect pro-life religious convictions so long as legislation reflecting contrary convictions remains possible, with certain occupational protections built in for cases where judicial rulings prevent pro-life legislation. Finally, I argue that insofar as the First Amendment itself may be thought to be justified on theological grounds, it is reasonable to form laws protecting human life at all stages based on the conviction that rights are rooted in the divine creation of human biological nature directed toward rational self-awareness and freedom, rather than simply on the actual exercise of such awareness in humans who have reached certain stages of development.","2011","2022-05-03 13:59:24","2022-05-26 13:43:51","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/WNKXAA3J/Manchester - Distinguishing Secular and Theological Justificati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critical to such discussions is the question of how we are to determine the nature of the embryo. Can science alone provide a definitive account of the embryo? In their recent book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen construct an argument defending the embryo from destructive experimentation based on this definition. The acceptance of certain modern presuppositions perhaps unwittingly lead the authors to accept a liberal conception of the human as an autonomous entity. This is revealed in the embryo’s need to behave and assert himself as an individual in order to be considered a human life. With no understanding of the ontological nature of the embryo as always in relation to a mother, a father, a family, and, ultimately, God, and no sense of the proper place for the embryo, there can be no adequate foundation for a proper ethical response.","2011","2022-05-03 13:59:19","2022-05-26 13:43:15","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/DTK5DETS/Christians are 'guardians of a metaphysics of the .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, the use of natural family planning (NFP) and the acceptance of fertility lend itself to the openness to life. The specific purpose of the paper is to describe the influence of contraceptive use and NFP on the likelihood of having an abortion among United States (US) women of reproductive age as found in Cycle 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). There were 7,625 women of reproductive age in cycle 7 of the NSFG, and of these 6,265 were sexually active. Likelihood Odds Ratios (OR) were used to determine the likelihood that ever use of common contraceptive methods and NFP correlates with ever having an abortion and having an abortion in the past 12 months. According to data from Cycle 7 of the NSFG, the ever use of methods of contraception (outside of surgical female sterilization) coincides with a likelihood of every having an abortion up to 209% with ever use of the male condom and 85% with use of the birth control pill. In a like manner ever use of contraceptive methods also imparts a likelihood of having an abortion in the 12 months with an extremely high likelihood of abortion with female sterilization and the use of the male condom. As a contrast, the ever use of NFP among US women does not have any significant likelihood of ever having an abortion nor of having an abortion in the past year. The conclusion is that the NSFG data provides evidence that contraception contributes to the likelihood of having an abortion and NFP prevents that likelihood. Promotion of the use of NFP among married couples and chastity among adolescents are ways of contributing to the culture of life.","2011","2022-05-03 13:59:15","2022-05-26 13:49:54","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/AD4BM536/Fehring - The Influence of Contraception on Abortion among W.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the social and cultural effects of same-sex sexual expression are remarkably similar to those of induced abortion. Like contraception, both contravene the natural operation of the body in order to conform human sexuality to the ideals of modernity – including unconditioned personal expression, availability to industrial capitalism, and reduced uncertainty in the life course. By severing the link between sex and children, both increase privatization, diminish the social intentionality and form of the sexual union, and undermine the unitive good and the transcendent goal of marriage. Movements for both gay rights and abortion rights employ similar rhetoric and share activist personnel, and gay rights activists strategically promote affinity with abortion rights.

"JPMBU4T8","journalArticle","2010","Silecchia, Lucia A","Toward a Pro-Life Environmental Movement","","","","","","In modern times, the secular environmental movement seems to have taken on an anti-life message, in ways both subtle and direct. This anti-human – and often anti-life – view has crept into the heart of the “mainstream” ecological movement with consequences that can be detrimental to both human dignity and to the environment itself.

Instead, it is a call to reflect carefully and soberly on the troubling moral consequences of grounding respect for the environment in disrespect for the dignity of the human person. The first part of the essay outlines the ways in which the ecological movement has run into conflict with pro-life values. This includes a discussion of both the anti-life rhetoric of the ecological movement and illustrative environmental policies that may have a detrimental effect on human life. The second part of the discussion sets forth the essential components of a pro-life vision of environmental responsibility and explores how the pro-life movement can enhance and renew the ecological movement.","2010","2022-05-03 13:59:03","2022-05-26 13:53:58","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/KU9F7FV7/Silecchia - Toward a Pro-Life Environmental Movement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bill nearly failed to pass the Congress, however, because of concerns about its possible anti-life effects. In the end, pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives, whose votes were essential to passage of PPACA, accepted President Obama’s promise to ensure PPACA was not anti-life. This article will (1) critically examine the process by which PPACA was passed, and (2) evaluate whether the “compromise” that emerged to save the bill respected pro-life concerns. The material in this article was presented to UFL in June 2010. Subsequently, there have been a number of developments –particularly with the implementation of the reform and with the content and enforcement of the “preventive services” mandate – that are not chronicled in this article.","2010","2022-05-03 13:59:02","2022-05-26 13:51:17","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/5PDMZ8PE/Saunders - Healthcare Reform A Pro-Life Perspective and a Pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"KZ342KBE","journalArticle","2010","Rienzi, Mark L","The Fourteenth Amendment Right of Conscience: Roe, Casey, and the Constitutional Right to Refuse","","","","","","Supreme Court precedents in Roe and Casey establish a pregnant woman’s right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion. Do those same precedents also protect her doctor’s right to decide whether to perform abortions? The Fourteenth Amendment rights of various parties in the abortion context – the pregnant woman, the fetus, the fetus’s father, the state – have been discussed at length by commentators and the courts. Surprisingly, the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the physician asked to perform the abortion have rarely been explored. The Court’s substantive due process analysis typically looks for rights that are “deeply rooted” in our history and traditions. Accordingly, this article addresses the historical basis for finding that physicians do indeed have a Fourteenth Amendment right to refuse to perform abortions. Ultimately, this historical analysis shows that the right to refuse actually has better historical support, and better satisfies the Court’s stated tests, than the abortion right itself. A physician’s right to make this decision without government compulsion also fits squarely within the zone of individual decision-making protected by the Court’s opinions in Casey and Lawrence v. Texas, and protects physicians from the types of psychological harm that the Court recognized in Roe and Casey. For these reasons, under Roe and Casey, a physician has a Fourteenth Amendment right to refuse to perform abortions.","2010","2022-05-03 13:59:01","2022-05-26 13:51:41","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/SB99IBXW/Rienzi - The Fourteenth Amendment Right of Conscience Roe,.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"B7GP53FG","journalArticle","2010","Myers, Richard S","A Comment on “The Constitutional Law and Politics of Reproductive Rights”","","","","","","One of the most interesting things about current legal scholarship is the continuing flow of articles re-evaluating Roe v. Wade. For example, in 2009 the Yale Law Journal published several essays from a conference that dealt with “The Constitutional Law and Politics of Reproductive Rights.” These essays were all from the perspective of those favoring abortion rights. I think these articles are quite instructive for prolife scholars. This paper reflects upon the principal lessons revealed through a careful reading of this scholarship. The articles indicate that Roe and Casey are still in play; these cases are not a settled part of the legal landscape. The articles, which typically suggest that the current law only protects a rather modest right to an abortion, also indicate that there is a continuing need to describe the current legal situation accurately. There is also a need to continue to focus on the harms of abortion – the harm to the unborn, of course, but also the harm to women. The articles also reflect a desire to move away from a focus on the courts. I think that is a sign of weakness for pro-choice academics, but it also reflects the importance of trying to promote a culture of life while at the same time trying to change the law. There has been progress in both areas. The prolife legal movement has made modest and important gains over the last two decades and there is an increasing pro-life sentiment in the broader culture. In sum, reflecting upon these articles leaves me with a sense of optimism about the long-range objective of building a culture of life.","2010","2022-05-03 13:58:59","2022-05-26 13:52:45","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/H9V5K8T5/Myers - A Comment on “The Constitutional Law and Politics .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To a large measure it is Thomson’s remarkable analogies that explain this sustained interest. They illustrate moral intuitions that appear to support abortion for all sorts of reasons, most of which have nothing to do with safeguarding the mother. No doubt her popularity comes from her conception of the origins of moral obligations, viz., that obligations only come from our informed and free consent to them. If a woman has not consented to becoming pregnant, she has no obligation to provide care for her unborn fetus. Thomson thinks that there is only a short step to justifying abortion. I respond to Thomson by examining two of her most compelling cases – the “violinist” and “people seeds” arguments.

(2) James Rachels, a philosopher and medical ethicist at the University of Alabama, merited praise in The New York Times for having launched the campaign for euthanasia by denying the difference between killing and letting die. Both men may be called post-human because they grounded their support for the culture of death on contempt for the human race–Hardin reduced us to numbers, while Rachels leveled us with beasts.

"EFHKYCC5","journalArticle","2006","Flood, Patrick J","Does International Law Protect the Unborn Child?","","","","","","In the debate on whether international law upholds an unborn child’s right to live or, conversely, a pregnant woman’s right to abort, this essay argues that the weight of the evidence in the relevant universal and regional legal instruments supports the former view. In addition to direct references to unborn life in some agreements, several instruments also call for certain kinds of state action that by their nature provide practical protection for the unborn child’s life. In short, the conclusion is that the available evidence points more often, more clearly, and with more weight to a preference for life. This is true of both universal agreements and all but one of the several regional human rights instruments. However, the new Protocol on Women’s Rights in Africa contains a paragraph on abortion that, while unsupported by other parts of that text as well as by universal and other African instruments, nonetheless represents a departure from the general pattern. The essay therefore analyzes the Protocol at somewhat greater length and suggests several ways to address its unusual provision on abortion. Finally, the essay outlines three concrete proposals to clarify, strengthen and complement existing international provisions for protection of unborn human life: (1) An African Protocol on the Rights of the Unborn Child, (2) A UN Declaration on the Protection of Unborn Children, and (3) Appointment by the Human Rights Council of a Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Unborn Children.","2006","2022-05-03 14:09:58","2022-05-26 14:19:53","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/EHHPRLK5/Flood - Does International Law Protect the Unborn Child.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to examine data from the 2002 NSFG in order to determine the influence of religiosity on abortion and abortifacient contraceptive use, i.e., the use of the oral contraceptive pill (OC), the injected hormone Depoprovera (IC), the IU D , and hormonal emergency contraception (EC), among American women between the ages of 15-44. The NSFG is a population-based selection of 7,676 women. The 2002 data set contains variables on whether the woman had ever used abortion, the above methods of family planning, and variables on the importance of religion, church attendance, and attitudes on sexuality. We found (based on statistical odds ratios) that those women who viewed religion as very important attended church frequently (i.e., at least once a week) and held traditional attitudes on religion were less likely to have had an abortion in the past twelve months and less likely to use OCs, ICs, and ECs. There was no difference in the likelihood of ever having used IUDs.

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, is that the Court failed to recognize the constitutional personhood of the unborn child within the meaning of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court’s majority opinion blatantly ignored the uncontroverted evidence of the personhood of the unborn in medicine, in law, and in literature already extant prior to the adoption of “personhood” protection in the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, from the standpoint of language and logical analysis, the legal separation of “human beings” from “persons” is artificial and arbitrary.","2008","2022-05-03 14:09:30","2022-05-26 14:06:29","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/3DTI6P46/Cetrulo - Constitutional Personhood of the Unborn Child.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this account focuses on abortion, it also reaches beyond abortion to other contested matters. It does so by grounding conscientious objection in medicine viewed as a profession. The paper articulates an account of medicine as a profession and asks how conscientious objection comports with medical professionalism. It presents the general features of a professional conscience clause. In particular, it develops the grounds for and the limits to conscientious objection to referral. Any coherent account of objection must include the ability to object to referring a patient. Instances in which the objecting practitioner has allowed the patient to develop a reliance, however, limit conscientious objection. The paper concludes with an articulation of the duties of the conscientious objector such as the promulgation of one’s objection, preservation of confidentiality in instances of objection, and full disclosure.","2009","2022-05-03 14:09:28","2022-05-26 13:58:40","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/R4L5ZDA9/Cavanaugh - Professional Conscientious Objection in Medicine w.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The former can be constitutionally prohibited, but the latter cannot. Why the distinction? For Posner, the former involves “killing a live baby that is half-born,” whereas the latter does not. This article will show that Judge Posner is correct to assert that killing a baby in the midst of the birth process is not constitutionally protected. But Judge Posner is wrong to say that partial-birth abortion does not kill “a live baby that is half-born.” This article will demonstrate that the partial-birth procedure in fact does kill a baby during its birth. Ban-proponents are correct in their long-standing argument that the partial-birth procedure is not really an abortion. Consequently, Roe, properly understood, is inapplicable to partial-birth abortion bans. Courts, however, including the U.S. Supreme Court in Carhart II, have nonetheless routinely used the analytical framework of Roe and Casey to evaluate bans. This common mistake undermines current partial-birth abortion jurisprudence. The rational basis test, not Roe/Casey, is the proper evaluative tool. Using the correct standard could have significant consequences for future challenges to the federal ban and to the bans of the various states.","2008","2022-05-03 14:09:17","2022-05-26 14:06:17","","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/9U6SYD95/Calhoun - “Partial-Birth Abortion” Is Not Abortion Carhart .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas opponents believe that the biological entity that carries out the nuclear reprogramming is a human embryo, this essay argues that such a conclusion is scientifically and philosophically untenable. It argues rather that the efficient cause of nuclear reprogramming is an unnatural ooplast-somatic cell hybrid, a biological construct not found in nature, whose active bodily potencies never exceed those of the vegetative order. Because a principal capacity of the cell at its origin is to convert itself, through a process of nuclear reprogramming, into a stem cell, it is reasonable to consider the product of nuclear transfer before and during reprogramming a stem cell.","2007","2022-05-03 14:09:15","2022-05-26 14:14:29","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/4F6JYNJ5/Brugger - Altered Nuclear Reprogramming and Efficient Causal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second is that children are relatively vulnerable as compared with adults and merit protection from the State when warranted. The author contrasts the themes and language in pre-Gonzales abortion law with the family law of parent-child relations.

Genetic engineering will inevitably focus on the ovum as science seeks to control all aspects of generation. It is imperative that we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the oocyte in relationship to the woman as bearer of life.

This conclusion further reveals the constitutional and moral deficiencies in the Supreme Court’s current approach.

They highlight the reality that abortion takes the life of a human being, and they do so in the context of abortions that are difficult for abortion rights advocates to defend.

We see these views partly through their preaching on the nature of the Christ Child in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes’s considerations of the Incarnation included teachings on the Christ Child in the womb, from his conception by the Holy Spirit to his birth.

We argue that the pro-life view can, in various ways, reject the assumption that defensive violence to save innocent individuals is always permissible. Now even if that assumption is accepted, we contend that defensive violence against abortion doctors still is not justified. Drawing on Frances Kamm’s work, we contend that there are structural similarities between abortion and letting someone die who needs your help to stay alive; and we argue that it is impermissible to kill those who kill in order to avoid giving life-saving aid.","2021","2022-05-03 14:05:44","2022-05-26 12:56:10","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/YJJ6IF45/Hershenov and Reed - How Not to Defend the Unborn.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v Wade, far from resolving a growing issue, nationalized it, made it difficult to legislate even minimal compromises, and was seen as an exercise in raw judicial power, lacking legitimacy. It enormously energized and enlarged the nascent right to life movement which became one of the most notable social movements in American history. The movement has been characterized by its diversity, grassroots activism and endurance in the face of constant vilification. The relative stability of public attitudes to abortion of the period is proof of its impact. It has been a major factor in American politics.

Several candidates in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine also utilize aborted human fetal tissue cell lines. Leading scientists involved in vaccine development openly affirm the dependency of their medical breakthroughs upon aborted (even vivisected) human fetuses and defend this practice by appealing to utilitarian ethics. Informed consent, both as an ethical principle and as a legal guarantee, generally affords competent adults the right to conscientiously refuse medical treatment and, to some degree, the right also to refuse on behalf of their minor children. Although the Jacobson (1905) ruling strongly favors the state’s authority to mandate vaccination, subsequent developments in fundamental rights jurisprudence should tilt the balance in favor of conscientious pro-life objections to abortion-derived vaccines. In the context of a pandemic emergency, however, the exercise of those rights may entail involuntary isolation or quarantine for thirty days or longer. In addition to asserting the rights to conscience, religious liberty, and bodily integrity, those who object to receiving an abortion-derived vaccine would also do well to expose the false assumption that nothing but a vaccine can protect the population against contagious disease.","2020","2022-05-03 14:04:59","2022-05-26 12:57:29","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/C8Q82V8X/MacPherson - Aborted Human Fetal Tissue in Vaccines Ethical an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the twenty-five years since John Paul II published Evangelium vitae, his analysis of the individual and cultural factors responsible for the killing of embryos via abortifacients, fetuses via abortion, and the dying via euthanasia has proven prescient. It is thus time to consider his remedies for countering the culture of death and promoting the culture of life. These remedies revolve around the person, the family, and socio-political activism. For John Paul II, the hub around which the culture of life and the culture of death both revolve is the human person, but the culture of life promotes more rewarding personal fulfillment. The key aspect of this fulfillment comes through exercising spousal love in families constituted either through marriage or through a relationship to God and the human family. The indispensability of families for personal fulfillment requires social and political activism in order to defend the person and build the culture of life.","2020","2022-05-03 14:04:56","2022-05-26 12:56:49","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/PPU7Y7SM/Lemmons - Roadmap to Building the Culture of Life Reflectio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this encyclical the pope analyzed the connections between use of contraception and abortion, encouraged the development of NFP centers, advised that NFP be provided to all married couples, urged health care professionals to be involved in teaching NFP, and recommended that universities be involved with research in NFP, especially to explicate NFP’s effectiveness. This paper provides evidence for the association of contraception with abortion, for the state of NFP among married couples in the United States, and gives examples of NFP centers that focus on women’s health. This paper also presents evidence for the effectiveness of NFP in helping couples to avoid and achieve pregnancy. In light of the pope’s call for universities to be involved with building a culture of life, this paper explains the Marquette University Institute for NFP as doing so through educating health care professionals in how to teach the Marquette Model system of NFP, by conducting NFP research, and by offering innovative NFP services. The paper ends echoing John Paul II’s call for women to be leaders in developing a culture of life by discussing ways health care professional women have promoted NFP through social media, the internet, innovative technology, and women’s health services.","2020","2022-05-03 14:04:49","2022-05-26 13:00:19","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/TMKUN2PE/Fehring - Evangelium vitae and Promoting a Culture of Life t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two years before Justice Kennedy retired, the Court introduced a great deal of uncertainty into its abortion jurisprudence in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. In Hellerstedt, the Court interpreted Casey’s undue burden standard to require a court to balance an abortion regulation’s benefits against its burdens in assessing the regulation’s constitutionality, leading Justice Clarence Thomas to accuse the majority of “reimagining” Casey’s standard in a way that “will surely mystify lower courts for years to come.” Whether the newly constituted Court will solve this mystery remains to be seen. In the meantime, lower courts must determine what Casey’s undue burden standard demands. And as states continue to experiment with new abortion-related measures and challenges are brought against regulations – both new and old – a coherent structure for applying the undue burden test is an urgent need.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:43","2022-05-26 13:04:30","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/P9DYX6K8/Molony - Liberty Finds No Refuge The Doubt-Filled Future o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By defining freedom primarily as the ability to overcome inconvenience and uneasiness and by defining personhood in terms of being able to rationally engage in political and economic activity, Locke’s approach lends itself to neglecting (and in some cases perhaps even ending the existence of) disabled and infirm individuals as well as possibly certain unborn offspring. They are regarded as lacking freedom in being unable to overcome uneasiness. Their existence seems an inconvenience that hampers the freedom of others. By comparison, Thomas regards all human offspring as being necessarily persons. Whatever their disabilities, their nature orients them toward eternal communion with God and others. Locke divides the social and religious ends of human persons, with socio-economic considerations driving his understanding of personhood in both cases. By comparison, Aquinas conceives of both social and ecclesial life as being infused by sacramental participation and as thereby oriented toward eternal sacramental communion with God. In his case, through the sacraments, all people – including the disabled and the unborn – are not only oriented toward their own salvation but play a profound (if in some cases inscrutable) role in the salvation of the whole world.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:40","2022-05-26 13:02:55","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/GU6I4ZZE/Manchester - The Disabled in Locke and Aquinas Impediments to .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fourth part criticizes philosophical pro-brain death arguments and argues that states ought to adopt the religious exemption enacted by the state of New Jersey, rather than the religious accommodation policy enacted by New York State. The essay concludes by arguing that justice demands that states repeal the laws identifying death with the brain’s inability to function. Until then the legalization of brain death threatens the living and inculcates values antithetical to caring for the vulnerable among us.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:37","2022-05-26 13:02:05","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/985TMCFX/Lemmons - Brain Death From Mistaken Assumptions to Legal Fi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"WMJXKJI3","journalArticle","2019","Koloze, Jeff","Critical Disability Studies and Fiction on the Right-to-Life Issues","","","","","","After supplying examples of jargon-laden academic discussion of critical disability studies, this paper summarizes major ideas that constitute this literary theory. Two life-affirming fictional works that concern abortion and infanticide (Carlos Fuentes’s Christopher Unborn and Lois Lowry’s The Giver) are then briefly examined, using key ideas from the theory. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to applying critical disability studies to a euthanasia work (the Million Dollar Baby franchise, consisting of the short story and its film equivalent). The discussions of these three works are amplified by providing further commentary from a pro-life perspective. Finally, the paper determines how the principles of critical disability studies comport with the five elements of right-to-life literary theory and demonstrates how critical disability studies is compatible with the aims of the pro-life movement, which counters the dehumanization of the disabled in anti-life fiction.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:36","2022-05-26 13:03:52","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/25P79YUQ/Koloze - Critical Disability Studies and Fiction on the Rig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A second purpose is to determine the influence of Church attendance and importance of religion on the likelihood of having an abortion among US reproductive age women. Findings show the ever use of contraceptive methods increased the likelihood of abortion from 56% to more than 11 times and that frequent church attendance and those women who hold religion to be very important in their lives decreased the likelihood of abortion compared to women who were not religious and not on the three methods of contraception.

We should, however, ask ourselves: “are we good simply because we feel good?” (AL 145). The aim of this essay is to salvage compassion as a basis for a Christian ethos. As Johan Baptist Metz puts it, in a world that looks for consolation “compassion unto God” is a double provocation. It is the clearest sign of God’s existence as existence “for us” as well as a sign of a mature faith. I will argue, based on the teaching of Abraham Joshua Heschel who defines a prophet as the “incarnation of God’s passion” that compassion is a modality of life within the realm of the covenant. Every Christian baptized into Christ stands on the side of the weak ones to witness the value of human life as well as to the power of God’s love.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:30","2022-05-26 13:01:42","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/AGB28VK7/Duran - Be Compassionate as your Father is Compassionate .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

George and Christopher Tollefsen have provided a defense of the life of early embryos against those who claim that such beings are not human beings. They masterfully summarize the findings of the most recent embryological research, referring to the studies and textbooks utilized by the highest level universities. These sciences have made it no longer possible to claim that an embryo is not a new distinct living human being. George and Tollefsen offer a concise and easily comprehensible presentation of these established scientific facts. But their view of human personhood is difficult to distinguish from epiphenomenalism and leaves the impression that the immaterial dimension of human persons has as its exclusive source the material body. They assert that the concept of “soul” will not make an appearance in their book, because that would be unneccessary and unhelpful. For this reason they tend to identify the “soul” with consciousness, reflection, choice, and the capacities that make those abilities possible. But these things need a foundational level of being in which to inhere. For George and Tollefsen this foundation is the body, which they refer to as the animal organism: this is the stance of epiphenomenalism. After giving a thorough expression of their position, I will offer a different explanation for explaining the unity of body and soul in persons, while avoiding the tendency towards epiphenomenalism. I call this view Realist Phenomenology/Christian Personalism1 and will contrast it with the New Natural Law approach represented in Embryo: A Defense of Life.","2019","2022-05-03 14:04:27","2022-05-26 13:02:17","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/WPUHGAVF/Colosi - The Importance of Philosophical Arguments for the .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, there is enough evidence to suggest that the literature comports more with a life-affirming philosophy, if not an overtly pro-life one. That is, the literature employs characters with same-sex attraction who do not necessarily support the killing of the unborn, the handicapped newborn, or the medically vulnerable or aged. Finally, this study demonstrates how using the five questions of right-to-life literary theory can provide an opportunity for persons with same-sex attraction to renounce their allegiance with the destructive elements of the contemporary gay and lesbian movement and, instead, align themselves with the pro-life movement, which is more compatible with their efforts to seek authentic love.","2018","2022-05-03 14:04:18","2022-05-26 13:12:49","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/4C2VU6PT/Koloze - Right-to-Life Issues in Contemporary Gay and Lesbi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abortion opponents often respond that a fetus is not a maternal part by stressing any or all of the following: differences in fetal and maternal DNA; the fetus does not function like a maternal body part contributing to the mother’s survival; the fetus’s developmental telos is towards independence from the mother; the fetus’s relation to the mother is that of a tenant to a niche, not a part to a whole; a fetus is a substance (a human being) and one substance cannot be a part of another substance. Drawing upon Elselijn Kingma’s work, I respond that these arguments provide little reason to doubt the claim that a fetus is a maternal part. Nevertheless, somewhat ironically, the fetal parthood thesis dooms the following three popular defenses of abortion: fetuses can be terminated on the grounds that they violate their mothers’ bodily integrity; fetuses can be killed for trespassing on their mothers’ bodies; fetuses can be aborted because pregnant women have a right to self-defense. These three defenses fail on merely conceptual grounds, for bodily parts cannot trespass upon the whole, nor can they violate the integrity of that whole, nor are they legitimate targets of a right to selfdefense if they are not external to the self.","2018","2022-05-03 14:04:16","2022-05-26 13:11:11","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/FUF347WV/Hershenov - If the Fetus is a Part of the Mother, then Three P.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many state statutes are modeled on the UDDA. The apnea test is the final test in many protocols for a person in unresponsive coma of known cause, presumably irreversible, and is considered by some the “sine qua non” for “brain death.” But even some physicians who are in favor of the concept of brain death and vital organ procurement have called it “not defensible.” In this paper we review the apnea test procedure in the context of basic respiratory physiology and ventilator use.

The curriculum persuaded 71% of the students who were formerly non-pro-life or uncommitted, to change their minds and become pro-life. The first step is to provide the students with a self-motivating rationale to move them from a dominant ego-comparative identity to a dominant contributive-empathetic identity – a conversion of the heart that enables them to be open to the six principles of civility and civilization embraced by secular culture – the principles of non-maleficence, universal personhood, just law, inalienable rights, the necessary hierarchy of rights, and the intrinsic limits to human freedom. The encouraging results from our initial surveys indicate the effectiveness of this approach in helping the culture to recognize the goodness and civility of the pro-life position.","2017","2022-05-03 14:04:03","2022-05-26 13:11:31","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/NERSRG4R/Spitzer - Toward a Universally Engaging Pro-Life Rhetoric.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"YPNDPC9I","journalArticle","2017","Metzger, Nathan","Are Brains Needed for Fetal Subjectivity?","","","","","","This paper argues that we have reason to broaden our ideas about the arrival of subjectivity in fetal development. It is often assumed that fetal subjectivity arises at a certain point in time on account of the development of the brain and that before there is sufficient development of the brain there is no reason to posit subjectivity in the developing child. There are, however, reasons for situating fetal subjectivity differently, given that our regular recourse to the language of irreducible substance needs to assume a richer and more mysterious philosophy of nature. There is simply no metaphysical reason for limiting minds to brains, given the failure of the mechanical model to explain mental activity, especially when mental semantics are already employed to describe the behavior of embryonic and fetal striving.","2017","2022-05-03 14:04:01","2022-05-26 13:12:15","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/E9XRHI3S/Metzger - Are Brains Needed for Fetal Subjectivity.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After illustrating this phenomenon with a recent case in which a midwife was fired and effectively blacklisted for refusing to perform abortions, I examine other cases to which it applies, including euthanasia. I note the similarities between the externalization of agency and the seemingly opposite phenomenon of excessive paternalism. In each case one agent’s perspective is entirely coopted by another.

We hypothesized that there is a greater likelihood of pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and sexual behaviors that enhance such problems (e.g., earlier sexual debut and multiple sex partners) for single adolescents and young adults currently using contraception than for adolescents and young adults not using contraception. To test this hypothesis, we used data from 1,365 adolescents and young adults in the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth to describe the influence of current use of contraception on sexual debut, multiple sex partners, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and abortion. We found that current use of contraception by adolescents and young adults in the U.S. results in a greater likelihood of pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases compared with the rates for those adolescents and young adults who never used oral contraceptives. Furthermore, those adolescents who currently use oral contraceptives had significantly more male sexual partners than those who never used them and an earlier sexual debut by almost five years. We concluded that the use of oral contraceptives by adolescents and young adults facilitates higher risk sexual behaviors. Further research is recommended to confirm these associations.","2017","2022-05-03 14:03:53","2022-05-26 13:13:38","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/9FZKBDGZ/Fehring et al. - Influence of Current Contraceptive Use on the Abor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effort to do bioethics from the existential point of view will produce its own unique challenges. This essay attempts to apply the insights of existential-phenomenology to the abortion debate. It argues that abortion is an act of existential despair by using Gabriel Marcel’s comments on the phenomenological notion of “having” and Kierkegaard’s understanding of despair as the self’s refusal to be itself.

Thus, if we are animalists, then we should lack the confidence required to apply lethal advance directives to the cheerfully demented, or so I argue. In short, there is consensus among animalists that the best way to avoid serious objections to their account is to adopt an ontology that denies the existence of brains, hands, tables, chairs, iced-tea, and lemonade. The adoption of such an ontology reduces the justificatory force of commonsense, which is key in arguing that we are animals and that we persist as long as we are biologically alive. With this loss of justification comes the loss of a high level of confidence that Quinn-pre-dementia’s lethal advanced directive applies to Quinn-post-dementia, via identity. If we do not have a high level of confidence that Quinn-pre-dementia’s advanced directive applies to Quinn-postdementia, then it is not enough (on its own) to let Quinn-post-dementia die.","2016","2022-05-03 14:02:39","2022-05-26 13:19:25","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/ZHCV8V5K/Limbaugh - Animals, Advance Directives, and Prudence Should .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, the appropriate response to death, to the loss of the good that is life, is sorrow.

"9M3LHAL6","journalArticle","2016","Cole, Joshua","Arguing Precisely Why Assisted Suicide is Wrong and Whether Morality Is More Like Math or Beauty","","","","","","Some defend assisted suicide on the basis of autonomy. It is tempting to respond that such a position is self-defeating: after death there is no person left to enjoy the value of autonomy. This response is especially attractive because it seems to require only logic. Using the thought of the philosopher Michael B. Gill, I argue that plausible accounts of the value of autonomy are not, in fact, selfdefeating. Rather, the argument against assisted suicide must make a positive case that human life is a gift of a particular dignity that forbids it to be intentionally destroyed. Furthermore, an analysis of this debate over the meaning of autonomy and human dignity provides insight into a question sometimes raised by moral philosophers. Is moral reasoning more like appreciating beauty or doing mathematics? I argue that a good moral argument requires both movements.","2016","2022-05-03 14:01:28","2022-05-26 13:18:19","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/RA97DVQT/Cole - Arguing Precisely Why Assisted Suicide is Wrong an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This understanding employs key concepts from the philosophical anthropologies of Søren Kierkegaard, Eric Voegelin, and René Girard in making the case that the deep-level, unconscious motives that impel human beings toward violent acts can be comprehended. These deep motives remain the same while the expressions of violence vary with time and place as conscious ideologies shift and change. Forms of violence that occur later in history are thus reenactments of earlier forms. Slavery was a vertical axis pathology; there are many variations on horizontal plane pathologies.

In the mid-1990s, it appeared that the Supreme Court might recognize a fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide. But in 1997, the Court rejected constitutional challenges to laws banning assisted suicide. Since then, the battle over assisted suicide has largely shifted to a state-by-state debate that has largely been conducted outside the federal courts. A few states have legalized physician-assisted suicide and public opinion has moved in favor of assisted suicide in the last few years but the overall situation has been relatively stable. There are, however, some worrisome trends. International developments and the increasing acceptance of a quality-of-life ethic create cause for concern. Fortunately, the Court’s 1997 decisions have created an opportunity for those who support the sanctity of life ethic to advance their views and to resist the “right to die” movement.","2014","2022-05-03 14:01:07","2022-05-26 13:26:29","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/T3GJ3DKW/Myers - Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the U.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I then proceed with a rebuttal of the argument that destruction of a body part essential for rational operations—such as the brain—necessarily entails that the remaining whole is indisposed to accrue a rational soul. Next, I point to the equivocal use of the terms “alive” or “living” as being at the root of conceptual errors about brain death. I appeal to the Thomistic definition of life and to the hylomorphic concept of “virtual presence” to clarify this confusion. Finally, I show how the Thomistic definition of life supports the traditional criterion for the determination of death.","2014","2022-05-03 14:00:57","2022-05-26 13:28:17","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/64JIA3CE/Accad - OF WHOLES AND PARTS.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lamenting an environmentally destructive dualism between man and nature, deep ecology seeks to rediscover the kinship between all living things. The kinship is in fact established by DNA on a microscopic level and by procreation on a behavioral level.

The study notes the fact that, despite dire predictions to the contrary, maternal mortality does not increase when abortion is prohibited, as studies within Latin America have shown.

For these situations the current medical profession often recommends sterilization, for either the woman or her spouse, so as to prevent an unintended pregnancy. The three cases involve: (1) a woman with breast cancer and on a medication that would result in a deformed child, (2) a woman with five children under the age of five who is currently breastfeeding an infant, and (3) a peri-menopausal woman who has a health problem and who has a significant risk for having a child with Down’s syndrome. The use of modern natural family planning (NFP) methods and special protocols developed by researchers at Marquette University to manage these special problems will be presented. An argument will also be made that the use of NFP is more healthy and beneficial for the woman, her potential child, her spouse, and family. Conversely, use of hormonal contraception is either medically contra-indicated in these situations or unnecessary.","2013","2022-05-03 13:59:43","2022-05-26 13:36:33","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/A2FP4BAS/Fehring - Preventing Unintended Pregnancies (the Natural Way.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The business aspects of the abortion industry are not widely known. They include supplying electively-aborted fetuses to industries that exploit them for economic gain. An unintended consequence of the essentially unencumbered right to abortion has been the creation of a vast and lucrative market in fetal tissue, fetal organs, and fetal parts.

It is extraordinary because of who the author was, on the one hand, and his radical endorsement of a pro-life philosophy on the other, at a time when fellow novelists and social reformers accepted as inevitable or actively promoted small families, contraception, and population control. The paper will proceed by first giving some background on Emile Zola, especially his views on the Catholic Church and science. It will then take up his notion of “salvation through love” and its relation to the family and procreation. These set the stage for a discussion of his ideas on life, love, and the population question in the novel Fécondité or Fruitfulness.","2007","2022-05-03 15:12:20","2022-05-26 14:16:56","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/2XQ9HVMV/Shivanandan - Emile Zola Improbable Defender of Life.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to Locke, human labor is responsible for all the value added to the nearly worthless materials provided by nature. Applied to the human person, this doctrine reduces the self to the will, places it in opposition to the world, and conceives of the body as property owned by the self. It also severs the moral and metaphysical bond of child and parent. The embryo becomes property not yet capable of exercising its will and claiming its self-ownership, and the generations are joined only by coincidence of interests. Pope Benedict XVI proposes, as the only adequate response to modern gnosticism, a recovery of the doctrine of creation, which grounds gratitude for the gift of life.","2007","2022-05-03 15:12:19","2022-05-26 14:18:51","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/BJRYRVZ4/Shiffman - John Locke and the Heart of Modern Gnosticism.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the constitutive relation to God and others that grounds human dignity and its call for authentic rights, and only a freedom filled with interiority and passion stemming from a memory of God will have the capacity in the end properly to recognize the dignity and rights of all, including the weakest. Thus, taking as its point of departure Evangelium Vitae’s teaching that two salient aspects of the culture of death are a self-centered notion of freedom and the “eclipse of the sense of God and of man,” the paper proposes that liberal democracy, even on its best reading, is unable to secure universal human dignity and rights because it understands persons and freedom in an ontologically self-centered way.","2007","2022-05-03 15:12:18","2022-05-26 14:16:28","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/R6J54PET/Schindler - Liberal Societies and the Foundations of Human Dig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are increasing pressures on healthcare professionals to conform their conduct to a secular vision of healthcare, even in situations when such professionals have a conscientious objection to facilitating, participating in, or performing various procedures. This paper evaluates the legal bases for conscientious objection in healthcare. Under current law, there is inadequate protection for those healthcare professionals who have religious and moral objections to governmental mandates. There is a pressing need for comprehensive protection for rights of conscience. Perhaps paradoxically, an effort to protect religious conscience has some risks because of the current pressures to privatize religion. In the long run, rebuilding a pro-life culture is the only sure protection for pro-life healthcare professionals.","2008","2022-05-03 15:11:56","2022-05-26 14:06:04","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/XY638UUH/Myers - Assessing the Legal Bases for Conscientious Object.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper cuts through the confusion by explaining the basics of stem cells, especially regarding the difference between research that focuses on embryonic stem cells and human cloning, as opposed to research that uses adult stem cells. Once the science involved with stem cell research is understood, the ethical issues involved become clear. Embryonic stem cell research, including the use of cloning to harvest such stem cells, is unethical because it destroys human embryos. However, research using adult stem cells raises no ethical concerns and promotes the true common good. The paper concludes with several success stories regarding the good news of adult stem cell research.","2007","2022-05-03 15:11:54","2022-05-26 14:13:54","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/JN3RTUIP/Morris - The Good News of Adult Stem Cell Research.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Another, entirely different kind of evil is found in its repercussions in the psyche of the parents, and especially of the mother of the aborted child. Both of these issues are frequently discussed in the abortion debate. In what follows, I will suggest another perspective on abortion, one not commonly addressed: a metaphysical and existential perspective, which examines how abortion constitutes a retroactive destruction of the union of the couple in the spousal exchange. The analysis will involve two parts: first, the mutual entailment of love and life and, second, a metaphysics of embodied existence. These considerations will bring to light the way in which abortion strikes at the heart of the exchange of persons accomplished in the spousal act.","2007","2022-05-03 15:11:53","2022-05-26 14:12:26","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/YHMK4TF9/Fedoryka - A Metaphysics of Love and Embodi- ment Abortion a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ironically, however, the seventeenth-century philosopher (and physician) John Locke, whose enormously influential defense of individual property (and other democratic) rights takes as its basis a fundamental right that one has over his or her own “person” (normally interpreted as “body”) explicitly declares abortion to be among the most obviously immoral actions. This article examines Locke’s view of pre-natal offspring, while demonstrating how his opposition to abortion is consistent with other aspects of his philosophy. I also examine how one author who takes Locke to defend only a limited pro-life position can develop Locke’s principles further in establishing a stronger case against abortion rights. I apply these insights to refute the arguments of three other scholars who appeal to Locke’s general political theory in defending abortion rights. Lastly, I consider the concerns of certain pro-life advocates that Locke’s principles, despite his own personal opposition to abortion, naturally tend toward alienated individualism and the commodification of human life in such a way as to lend support to an abortion rights culture.","2006","2022-05-03 15:11:49","2022-05-26 14:24:55","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/EMU34ISB/Manchester - Locke on Bodily Rights and the Immorality of Abort.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"CUPUZVAD","journalArticle","2009","Manchester, Eric","Fichte’s Idealism and Natural Rights: A Key to Understanding Seemingly Inconsistent Arguments for Abortion and Euthanasia","","","","","","Abortion and euthanasia opponents are often puzzled by the seemingly inconsistent position held by defenders of these practices. Prematurely-born infants, for example, are regarded as having a right to life while more physically developed fetuses are not. By contrast, in respect to euthanasia, greater physical functionality generally diminishes the degree to which death is considered acceptable. Such inconsistencies are surprisingly cogent when considered in light of the rights theory advanced by the eighteenth-century idealist philosopher G. W. Fichte. Fichte’s views often coincide with contemporary liberal convictions, including the beliefs (1) that the fetus is a part of a woman’s body, (2) that morality cannot be legislated, (3) that religious institutions should refrain from political discourse that challenges “rational” secular values, and (4) that one has a right to do whatever he or she wishes, as long as it does not directly interfere with another’s body. This essay examines how Fichte’s idealism develops conceptions of nature, personhood, and rights that justify abortion and euthanasia. But despite the rigor of Fichte’s system, it can only avoid the charge of making certain ad hoc metaphysical commitments that are in tension with other contemporary liberal convictions by supplementing its idealistic account of personhood and rights with certain biological criteria that actually undermine the case for abortion and euthanasia.","2009","2022-05-03 15:11:48","2022-05-26 13:59:22","","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/JBC2GLCB/Manchester - Fichte’s Idealism and Natural Rights A Key to Und.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In each case, however, a coercive reality lies behind the pro-choice rhetoric. That is to say, advocates for the apparent right to choose seek legislation that ultimately coerces dissenters to become complicit against their will. The current political debates on these issues therefore bear close analogy to America’s antebellum debates over slavery: rhetoric that initially seemed to be an argument for states’ rights or popular sovereignty soon revealed itself to be an emergent national policy that required all non-slaveholders, including abolitionists, to take action in support of the slavery regime. Similarly, political activists who deploy pro-choice rhetoric in favor of abortion or physician-assisted suicide resort to coercion in order to obtain and exercise the power to make such choices. Arguably, it cannot be otherwise, for coercion is necessary to maintain widespread social acceptance of choices that so fundamentally violate natural law.","2009","2022-05-03 15:11:46","2022-05-26 14:02:04","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/RAFTRKH4/Fugitive Slave Act.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistency and trauma were rated as moving toward opposition on practices that the respondents favored, but primarily with respondents who opposed one practice but favored the other. Those who favored both were less impressed. An argument favoring abortion to deter crime by eliminating future criminals also moved people who favored abortion availability toward opposing abortion.

Wade and abortion remains an inconclusively disruptive part of every Supreme Court nomination process and every presidential election. While decades old national surveys show only glacial change in public opinion, though in a prolife direction, the public debate has changed in morally significant ways. Abortion opponents now unanimously accept that stopping abortion requires comprehensive help for woman who are pregnant and tempted to abortion by life circumstances–often of poverty and male irresponsibility. Abortion proponents increasingly acknowledge that abortion most often is more an unhappy decision than the consciousness enlarging experience intrinsic to the practice of authentic human rights. To continue as a vital cultural presence, social movements require both prudence and telos. Since the 1992 Supreme Court Casey decision the pro-life movement has prudently pursued an “incremental way” characterized by persuasion, assistance, and truth. But to remain vital, prudence requires an explicit beckoning horizon, a telos. The animating moral core, the essence, the ultimate goal of the movement opposing abortion is to become ever more consistently pro-life in its commitment to nonviolence. The ultimate fates of the peace and pro-life movements are morally intertwined.","2009","2022-05-03 14:12:24","2022-05-26 14:05:20","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/JHE3UDP6/Koterski - PRUDENCE AND TELOS IN PRO-LIFE EVOLUTION.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reductive concept of nature reveals an improper notion of freedom. When freedom is conceived fundamentally as choice, nature is stripped of any inherent value and subordinated to the dictates of man. Thomas Aquinas reveals a fuller account of freedom that is responsive to the goodness already present in nature, thereby restoring a sense of interiority to nature. There is an intrinsic value to the oocyte in its natural end that is entirely distinct from any purposes we may intend. Drawing on John Paul II’s nuptial meaning of the body and the understanding of natural inclinations in Aquinas, I hope to develop the value of the oocyte within the context of the goodness of sexual union. Since the natural end of the oocyte is to form new life, attempts to divert it from this path not only frustrate the telos of the oocyte but ultimately violate the woman, the marital act, marriage, and love, thus serving as an affront to God and the “procedures” that he has set up for the continuation of humanity.","2009","2022-05-03 14:10:57","2022-05-26 13:59:02","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/6QNEG39Z/Henkel - Citation for the following article.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voting is an act of cooperation in the acts of others, and so must be analyzed on those grounds. By means of a description of the Church’s natural law understanding of the relation between the person, morality, law, and the State, Sections I through VI establish a set of principles concerning the gravity of the goods or evils in which we might cooperate by our vote, so as to enable us to analyze the proportionality involved in the decision. Sections VII and VIII explain the circumstances under which it is legitimate to cooperate in another’s evil acts, which one often does when one votes.

In this essay I identify and criticize Maritain’s “argument from complexity” and his “argument from virtual presence.” Together, these arguments lead him to claim that the embryo is not formally a human. In addition, I assess Maritain’s explicit efforts to link his inadequate embryology with what he presents as the core of a Thomist theory of evolution. Embryology, he insists, models evolution. To support his case, however, Maritain introduces a category of transformational change, the use of which proves incompatible with numerical identity over time.

Many state statutes are modeled on the UDDA. The apnea test is the final test in many protocols for a person in unresponsive coma of known cause, presumably irreversible, and is considered by some the “sine qua non” for “brain death.” But even some physicians who are in favor of the concept of brain death and vital organ procurement have called it “not defensible.” In this paper we review the apnea test procedure in the context of basic respiratory physiology and ventilator use.

Wade from a perspective of forty years is a valuable experience. Re-reading Roe reveals again how weak the opinion is at so many levels. That is one reason why I am optimistic that the decision will ultimately be overturned. The Supreme Court and the American system do have the capacity for self-correction and the deep flaws in Roe v.

This schema is used to classify important thinkers, describe political structures, interpret modern culture, and analyze the abortion debate. Sin is, at root, the refusal of human beings to inhabit these dimensions in their complexity and richness; sin is an artificial narrowing of human consciousness that overemphasizes a particular dimension. Slavery overemphasized the vertical axis, Marxism the horizontal plane, abortion the role of individual autonomy. The paradox revealed by dimensional anthropology is that the pro-choice position is both too big and too small at the same time; it puffs up the individual to god-like status while shrinking the circumference of moral concern down to narcissism.","2011","2022-05-26 13:45:20","2022-05-26 13:45:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/ZUB8ITUC/UFL_2011_Bellinger.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper offers a case that allowing some of these cryogenically stored embryos to thaw and die, and to dispose of their remains in a manner that reflects their status, is morally acceptable in that it is consistent with the principles that many accept as governing the removal of life-sustaining treatment in end-of-life cases.","2011","2022-05-26 13:46:17","2022-05-26 13:46:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/JYVFQTM2/UFL_2011_Tully.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pro-life aim of persuasion, empowerment to think more deliberatively, is contrasted with propaganda, which reduces critical faculties. Cognitive research shows that the perceived outcomes of making abortion illegal carry important associated subjective likelihoods and value judgments, and that pro-life attitude shifts occur simply by contesting pro-choice claims with novel challenges. Motivational approaches show that defensiveness will hinder persuasion attempts, but these may possibly be reduced through affirmation of the sense of self. Relational and network perspectives show that attitudes are socially infectious, and people are embedded in clumpy-segregated echo-chambers that produce extreme positions. Using this framework, pro-lifers can have more influence through an outreach-oriented mindset by forming relationships within targeted clusters, reducing defensiveness, and challenging pro-choice ideas with novel information using a framework of outcome likelihoods and value-judgments.","2011","2022-05-26 13:49:06","2022-05-26 13:49:39","2022-05-26 13:49:06","0000102202154088841067","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/ICHTPLRB/Rothman et al. - 2005 - Politics and Professional Advancement Among Colleg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certainly, it does not look like a person when its life begins, or in the first stages of it existence. But in its genetic makeup, it has the active potency that enables it to develop the characteristics that we associate with personhood. The modern concept of personhood, following the thought of John Locke, focuses upon consciousness as the essence of personhood. Modern philosophers believe that consciousness is acquired over time, and is at times latent. Thus the concept of potency is not foreign to modern thought concerning personhood. There are many bioethicists who admit that the embryo or zygote is a living being, but they are not willing to affirm that it is a human being at the time of its formation. An analysis of their arguments results in an affirmation that the embryo is a person in the sense indicated above. While the Church has not stated definitely that the embryo is a human person, it has affirmed the need to respect it as such. Maintaining that human life begins at fertilization does not imply that human life is an absolute good.","2006","2022-05-26 14:22:25","2022-05-26 14:23:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/JS3FCQG4/o'rourke06.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the attitudes, intentions, and ethical stance of advanced practice nursing students towards the provision of abortion services. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 53 advanced practice nursing students at a private Midwestern Catholic university. A multi-item abortion attitude survey was administered to students in three required courses. The survey included a section on ethical principles and open-ended questions on abortion attitudes. The nursing students were either in a woman-related specialty, pediatrics, or in general adult nursing; most were between the ages of 24-29 (60.5%); and most (66.0%) were Roman Catholic. A majority (61.5%) did not feel that abortion should be available under any circumstance. However, 54% felt that advanced practice nurses should be able to provide abortion services. Few (7.7%) plan on incorporating abortion into their practices but 74.4% would refer for abortion services. The most frequent reasons for not willing to provide abortion were: (1) out of scope of practice (53.8%), (2) religious beliefs (59.0%), and (3) personal values (64.1%). The respondents for most part indicated either Sacred Life (43.6%) or Human Life/Utilitarian (48.7%) as their ethical stance. The Human Life/Utilitarian students had a significantly higher willingness to provide abortion services than Sacred Life students (p < 0.05).

"4BE55SLR","journalArticle","2005","Reimers, Adrian J","Ensoulment Problems","","","","","","One of the most frequently disputed questions in the contemporary abortion controversy concerns the moment of ensoulment, the moment at which the fetus ceases to be simply a living organism and becomes a human person. Although some commentators allege that Thomas Aquinas, among others, held to a theory of delayed ensoulment, the real issue for modern thinkers is the moment (if there is such) of the onset of conscious personhood. Identifying personhood with self-consciousness, autonomy, and evident rationality, many contemporary thinkers maintain that the fetusCand indeed the newborn infantCalthough human, does not qualify as a person. This conception of person is ideally suited for a utilitarian ethics, whose premises are founded in consciousness. After showing how Aquinas=s problem was quite different from the modern version, this article rejects the characterization of the person in terms of consciousness, arguing instead that transcendence toward the good in truth is the distinctively human. All human beings except the most immature and badly injured manifest this transcendence, if only to a limited extent. This transcendence cannot be attributed to any mechanical or physical system, but requires an immaterial seat in the human subject. An immaterial principle, or soul, is required to account for this transcendence. The paper concludes with a short ethical reflection on inappropriateness of the utilitarian response to the very immature and the physically or mentally compromised.","2005","2022-05-26 14:38:25","2022-05-26 14:38:31","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/954JJZ24/Reimers - Ensoulment Problems.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The notion of toleration operative here is problematic since it implicitly includes acts of murder that are legislatively affirmed as rights even though heavily regulated to reduce their incidence. The author argues that one reason for this form of “toleration” is the failure to distinguish in every abortion the moment of morality from the moment of justice. The difference between the finality of moral and legal prohibitions establishes the basis for determining whether or not the state has the competence to legislate morality. The immorality of a behavior that has moral consequences for the agent of the act is irrelevant and an improper reason for legislation. Of direct relevance is the right to or the legitimate ownership of one’s life. It is not something that can be regulated or restricted. Compromise laws do precisely that and are therefore intrinsically unjust. Their appeal lies in the fact that a larger number of unborn lives could be saved due to the regulation of abortion. But exchanging the lives of the few in order to gain an advantage for the “more” is intrinsically unjust since the legislator has no right to give up in a compromise law what belongs not to him but to the victim of injustice. Any “compromise law” that regulates abortions and thereby achieves a reduction in their number is intrinsically unjust even though it effects a greater good.","2004","2022-05-26 14:41:52","2022-05-26 14:42:00","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/HMZBK9VI/Fedoryka - What Happens to the Victims of Compromise Abortion.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They argue that it therefore amounts to persecution, a violation of religious liberty, to restrict women’s access to abortion. This new attempt to seize the high moral and religious ground from the defenders of unborn life is bold in the extreme, but ultimately incoherent and unpersuasive. For the claim that abortion is “sacred” in the world’s religions is just not supported by the facts that are brought forward.

Through an investigation of the nature of obligations in general, this essay shows that neither “choice,” nor the alleged onset of “personhood,” nor the birth of a child can reasonably be said to mark the onset or be the ground of such duties. However attractive the notion of “planned parenthood” may be, the ethical voluntarism of the pro-choice movement effectively does away with parental obligations and, to that extent, does away with the family.","2004","2022-05-26 14:44:11","2022-05-26 14:44:21","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/PM3J58VL/Peach - Abortion and Parental Obligation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PJ9S2QKX","journalArticle","2004","Fedoryka, Damian P","The Use of Force in a Culture of Death","","","","","","The present essay addresses the status of a debate in which the pro-choice side has co-opted and determined the use of language in such a way that tips the debate by the definition of terms in favor of the pro-choice position. An uncritical engagement in such debate results in the impotence of the pro-life movement. One such term is “violence,” which is simply defined as the use of force in opposition to some subjective claim. The thesis of the essay is that violence is the unjust use of force and that therefore it is the context of justice that establishes the proper meaning of such terms as “force” and “rights.” The foundation of rights is human existence received as a gift that calls for reciprocity in self-giving. The latter necessarily presupposes selfpossession or ownership of one’s own being. Legitimate selfpossession justifies the use of force in keeping what is one’s own over against someone who would appropriate it. This metaphysical status of self-possession is the objective foundation for both human dignity and the subjective experience of it. It explains both the possibility of victimhood and of aggression. It also explains the fact that an unjust aggressor will experience the just use of force in defense of the victim as a violation of his own (the aggressor’s) dignity. This experience of violated human dignity plays a fundamental role in the debate and is appealed to against any presumptive divine or human sovereignty that would hinder the claim to what one wants, in this case, the abortion.

"AGEXWV66","journalArticle","2003","Sullins, D Paul","Abortion and Family Formation: Circumstance or Culture?","","","","","","Research using opinion surveys and abortion-patient censuses has found that opinion and practice on abortion often appear incongruent. This is generally attributed to circumstantial pressures that motivate women to make an atypical choice, conceived in terms of rational utility; but it may also be due to the fact that the socio-cultural values of women having abortions are not representative of their opinion group. Taking participation in marriage and family formation behavior as indicators of traditional cultural values, I examine fertility data from the National Survey of Family Growth (N=10,847) in order to determine whether women having abortions differ significantly in their opinions regarding such behaviors from those not having abortions. I find that women having abortions are twice as likely never to marry, 37% more likely to divorce, have (on average) twice as many lifetime sexual partners and three times as many partners before marriage, have fewer children, and experience both earlier sexual onset and later marriage. Having successive abortions or abortions on different pregnancies affects these differences not at all or only slightly. I argue that these differences suggest that abortion decisions stem in large part from diverse sociocultural values rather than from circumstantial concessions.","2003","2022-05-26 15:32:49","2022-05-26 15:32:59","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/D35GRQEY/Sullins - Abortion and Family Formation Circumstance or Cul.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WDUTANH3","journalArticle","2002","Fehring, Richard J; McGraw, Elizabeth","Spiritual Responses to the Regulation of Birth (A Historical Comparison)","","","","","","Over 30 years ago the founders of the Christian Family Movement (CFM), a worldwide Catholic family action group, conducted a survey to investigate the marital effects of practicing “rhythm.” Their final report indicated that many participants felt that periodic abstinence was harmful to their marriage and caused spiritual and religious distress. The CFM survey results were thought to have been influential in convincing the 1966 Papal Birth Control Commission to recommend a change in church teaching. The purpose of this paper is to report a re-analysis of the 1966 archived data (in the light of the Papal Encyclical Humane Vitae–On the Regulation of Birth) and to compare that study with responses from married couples using modern methods of NFP, i.e., methods that purport to be more effective and to have fewer days of periodic abstinence. This paper will provide an examination of the original study within its historical context and report on the responses relating to spirituality from the 1966 couples in comparison with couples currently practicing periodic abstinence through the Billings Ovulation Method.","2002","2022-05-26 15:39:23","2022-05-26 15:45:00","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/J76MIYBD/Fehring and McGraw - Spiritual Responses to the Regulation of Birth (A .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Analysis of Outcome Data of the 1998-99 Teen STAR Program","","","","","","The efficacy of the Teen STAR Program for undergirding virginity and/or facilitating a return to chastity has been reported previously. We now correlate behavioral outcome with program components of the 199899 cohorts. There were 48 French, 23 Swiss and 234 U.S. females aged 11-17 who followed the 8-month program, which joins experiential learning of fertility signs to a developmental didactic curriculum that_includes regular teacher-student interviews; there were also 371 males aged 11-16 who followed a parallel program. A_ previously validated Likert-type_ 18-item questionnaire identified demographics, participants’ expectations for future abstinence,_ control of their emotions,_ empathy in dealing with others, overall helpfulness of the program, frequency of topical discussions with parents and friends,_ age at first intercourse, time of_ last intercourse, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and_ reasons for abstinence._ Reasons for abstinence offered insight into the locus of control.","2000","2022-05-03 14:12:53","2022-05-26 17:44:40","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/XACBRQY8/Klaus - Does Premature Intercourse Delay Psychological Mat.pdf; /home/lalor/Zotero/storage/N7QZSHQ6/Klaus - Does Premature Intercourse Delay Psychological Mat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"AK9EPG4L","journalArticle","1997","LaMonica, Teresa","ADOPTION: NOT AN EASY OPTION","","","","","","ADOPTION IS A VIABLE OPTION in our society today but one that holds lasting consequences for all those involved in the adoption triad: birth parents, adoptive parents, and the adoptee. One should not underestimate its effect on any of these parties. Like organ transplants, there are definite benefits for the recipient but a high cost to the donor. The act of adoption always exacts a cost from someone. Even in the best scenarios, where there is much preparation and support, there is a process of grieving that must be worked through for all those involved. This article will attempt to dispel some of the commonly held myths about adoption and look at the process through the perspective of each member of the adoption triad.","1997","2022-05-03 15:12:34","2022-05-26 17:42:39","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/lalor/Zotero/storage/NQ88PV9M/LaMonica - ADOPTION NOT AN EASY OPTION.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
