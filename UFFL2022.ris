TI  - Reflections on the Twentieth Anniversary of Planned Parenthood v. Casey
AU  - Myers, Richard S
AB  - Regarded by Michael Paulsen as the worst constitutional decision of all time, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) was a momentous decision. The Court seemed poised to overrule Roe v. Wade. In the end, Justice Kennedy joined with Justices O’Connor and Souter to author the (in)famous joint opinion that upheld the essence of Roe v. Wade while abandoning some of Roe’s key features. Casey has generated a great deal of commentary and been influential in certain respects. On the twentieth anniversary of the decision, this paper examines the Casey decision and assesses its impact on the law of abortion, on the law of substantive due process, and on the role of stare decisis in constitutional litigation.

TI  - A Hidden Agenda? The Politics of Abortion under a Majority Conservative Canadian Government
AU  - Mathie, William
AB  - Canada became one of the only countries in the world with no legal restrictions on abortion when its Supreme Court struck down its existing law in 1988. A very weak law against abortion was defeated by a tie vote of Canada’s Senate in 1990, opposed by opponents of abortion because of its weakness and by friends of abortion happy to have no law. In 2011 Canada’s Conservative party led by Stephen Harper obtained a parliamentary majority. The party included many MPs who wanted to see abortion restricted but its leader had promised to prevent any debate on abortion in the House. His political foes nevertheless accused Harper of having a hidden agenda. This essay explores the dilemma Harper faced as he tried to prevent the debate that many of his supporters wanted and the lessons that might be learned from that experience by Harper’s successor if and when he achieves power.

AU  - Koloze, Jeff
AB  - This paper considers literature written by American Latino authors who address any of the three life issues: abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. After surveying literary criticism of recent Latino literature, the paper focuses on works in three separate genres: Tato Laviera’s poem “Jesús Papote” (1981), the prose passage “Silent Dancing” (1990) by Judith Ortiz Cofer, and the film Bella (2006). The paper explicates and critiques these works so that non-Latino audiences can appreciate the themes evoked in the literature.

TI  - The Abolition of Chattel Abortion
AU  - Hallen, Cynthia
AB  - Current events warrant an expanded definition of abortion-on-demand as (1) a violent death sentence, (2) a source of pollution, (3) a dangerous method of birth control, (4) a disempowering deviance, (5) a dismantling of family relations and marital intimacy, and (6) a business for profit, not unlike the slave trade in the nineteenth century. Today’s abortion-rights arguments are parallel to nineteenth-century pro-slavery arguments. Those who said that slaves were not legal persons had to fail. Someday soon the tiny human beings who are not yet born will have protection as legal persons. Medical and technological advances will continue to roll back the frontiers of inner space in defining the genesis of human life. There is no excuse for non-therapeutic elective birth-control chattel abortion. Legal arguments, philosophy proofs, and political slogans cannot justify the extermination of unborn human beings any more than such language could justify the practice of chattel slavery.

TI  - The Influence of Contraception on Abortion among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States
AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - A common notion is that contraception is necessary for women (and couples) to avoid unwanted pregnancies and abortions. The thesis of this paper is that contraception actually leads to more (not less) abortions. On the other hand, the use of natural family planning (NFP) and the acceptance of fertility lend themselves to an openness to life. The specific purpose of the paper is to describe the influence of contraceptive use and of NFP on the likelihood of having an abortion among women of reproductive age. The rate of those who at one time or another used any method of contraception coincides with the likelihood of ever having an abortion to a high degree. By contrast, those who at any time used NFP do not have any significant likelihood of ever having an abortion. From the data studied, it appears that contraception contributes to the likelihood of having an abortion and NFP prevents that likelihood. Promotion of the use of NFP among married couples and chastity among adolescents are ways of contributing to the culture of life.

TI  - René Girard and the History of Rights Language
AU  - Bellinger, Charles K
AB  - Rights language is an important aspect of contemporary American politics and cultural discussion. It is also very puzzling, for there is so little consensus concerning what rights language means. When advocates of widely differing, and perhaps opposing, social policies invoke rights language and believe that it decisively supports their cause, both the importance and the puzzling nature of rights are brought to the forefront of our consciousness. The abortion debate is a particularly clear example of this. I will refer to it from time to time below, even though this essay is not focused on abortion per se. I will outline some of the competing philosophical schools of thought on rights, with attention to their historical roots. I will then propose an approach to rights language that I find to be implied in the writings of French author René Girard, an approach that differs in significant ways from the various schools of thought. Girard’s reflections will lead to a reconsideration of a key figure in the history of political thought, John Locke. I will argue that Locke’s approach to rights fits well with Girard’s historical narrative. I seek to establish that the current disarray in the use of rights language could be reduced if more attention were paid to Girard’s suggestion that the purpose of rights language is to build a linguistic hedge around human beings to prevent them from being victimized.

TI  - Anti-Choice: When Having a Choice Diminishes Family Solidarity
AU  - Stith, Richard
AB  - This article explores a little-noticed dimension of abortion and assisted suicide (or voluntary euthanasia): how choosing to reject those options can have a negative impact on the legally authorized choosers. Women who refuse abortion may be blamed for their choice by boyfriends, neighbors, employers, and others. Similarly, infirm or dying persons may find family and other caregivers upset by their refusal to agree to assisted suicide when voluntary death seems the sensible option. Finally, the author questions whether a life chosen as an option can ever have the dignity of a life simply accepted; that is, whether the child whom a mother once chose not to abort suffers from her having been able to choose otherwise, and whether the severely disabled but suiciderejecting person suffers from having to justify her continued existence.

TI  - The San Jose Articles and an International Right to Abortion
AU  - Saunders, William L
AB  - Abortion advocates are on a mission to establish an “international” right to abortion using “soft norms” under customary international law. Their ultimate goal is to weave throughout the various sources of customary international law language implying an international consensus that abortion is a necessary component of fundamental health services that must be provided by States to their citizens. If national bodies, including courts, accept the notion that an international customary law right to abortion exists, those bodies could impose it upon their citizens.

TI  - Distinguishing Secular and Theological Justifications of the First Amendment: Implications for Pro-Life Legislation
AU  - Manchester, Eric
AB  - The contention of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that government may neither establish any religion nor prevent the free exercise of religion allows for these restrictions to be conceptually justified on either theological or secular terms. Consequently, there is no prima facie reason to insist that the enactment of laws, including those concerning “life issues,” cannot be motivated by particular religious convictions so long as the legislation does not mandate religion as such. This is even more evident when one considers that (1) any attempt to prohibit such influence would illicitly stipulate that one is not free to exercise one’s religious convictions in this way, and (2) that the coupling of clauses on religious liberty with further clauses in the Bill of Rights protecting free speech, assembly, and petition suggests a presumption that religious convictions will be able to play a role in the formation of public policy. Given this, I propose a principle of equitability whereby laws can reflect pro-life religious convictions so long as legislation reflecting contrary convictions remains possible, with certain occupational protections built in for cases where judicial rulings prevent pro-life legislation. Finally, I argue that insofar as the First Amendment itself may be thought to be justified on theological grounds, it is reasonable to form laws protecting human life at all stages based on the conviction that rights are rooted in the divine creation of human biological nature directed toward rational self-awareness and freedom, rather than simply on the actual exercise of such awareness in humans who have reached certain stages of development.

AB  - This is a brief overview of the history of abortion in the United States, from colonial times to the present. Factors such as family structure, the role of children in a family’s economic life, the science of embryology, social mores, attitudes toward women, and political power have had an impact on the legal treatment of unborn children and their mothers. Legal changes were brought about in response to these changes and the interaction of factors must be considered when planning further course of action. Abortion presents a question that is core to our understanding of American democracy.

TI  - The Role of Metaphysics and Theology in the Contemporary Pro-Life Debate
AU  - Henkel, Kimberly Zenarolla
AB  - Recent debates over Altered Nuclear Transfer (ANT) and Embryo Transfer (also referred to as “Embryo Adoption”) are challenging moral theologians, philosophers, and scientists to define the boundaries of ethical pursuits. Critical to such discussions is the question of how we are to determine the nature of the embryo. Can science alone provide a definitive account of the embryo? In their recent book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen construct an argument defending the embryo from destructive experimentation based on this definition. The acceptance of certain modern presuppositions perhaps unwittingly lead the authors to accept a liberal conception of the human as an autonomous entity. This is revealed in the embryo’s need to behave and assert himself as an individual in order to be considered a human life. With no understanding of the ontological nature of the embryo as always in relation to a mother, a father, a family, and, ultimately, God, and no sense of the proper place for the embryo, there can be no adequate foundation for a proper ethical response.

Martin Rhonheimer’s theory about the bearing of vital conflict situations – in which, for instance, the life of a mother might be spared if her fetus is aborted, otherwise she and the fetus will die – upon the object of the act performed. It argues that the use of vital conflict situations in the way Lysaught and Rhonheimer (and possibly others) do is incompatible with Church teaching. The article concludes by suggesting a way of analyzing certain cases in such a way that the mother’s life is saved and the fetus dies but there is no direct abortion.

TI  - The Influence of Contraception on Abortion among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States
AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - There is a common notion that contraception is necessary for women (and couples) to avoid unwanted pregnancies and abortions. The thesis of this paper is that contraception actually will lead to more (not less) abortions. On the other hand, the use of natural family planning (NFP) and the acceptance of fertility lend itself to the openness to life. The specific purpose of the paper is to describe the influence of contraceptive use and NFP on the likelihood of having an abortion among United States (US) women of reproductive age as found in Cycle 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). There were 7,625 women of reproductive age in cycle 7 of the NSFG, and of these 6,265 were sexually active. Likelihood Odds Ratios (OR) were used to determine the likelihood that ever use of common contraceptive methods and NFP correlates with ever having an abortion and having an abortion in the past 12 months. According to data from Cycle 7 of the NSFG, the ever use of methods of contraception (outside of surgical female sterilization) coincides with a likelihood of every having an abortion up to 209% with ever use of the male condom and 85% with use of the birth control pill. In a like manner ever use of contraceptive methods also imparts a likelihood of having an abortion in the 12 months with an extremely high likelihood of abortion with female sterilization and the use of the male condom. As a contrast, the ever use of NFP among US women does not have any significant likelihood of ever having an abortion nor of having an abortion in the past year. The conclusion is that the NSFG data provides evidence that contraception contributes to the likelihood of having an abortion and NFP prevents that likelihood. Promotion of the use of NFP among married couples and chastity among adolescents are ways of contributing to the culture of life.

An analysis of his methods reveals inconsistencies in his reasoning. The doctrinal content supporting abortion rights that he claims to have found in each of the religions that he examines does not in fact exist.

The sermon was pertinent to its own time and remains so to ours. Its effectiveness was largely due to the use of classical rhetoric as formulated and practiced by Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian and others in ancient Greece and Rome. Relying heavily on both civil and divine law, the bishop exposed the wickedness of the initiative. As a result of the sermon’s public delivery and far-reaching dissemination, this Lion was in danger of being caged, if not slaughtered. In effect, Hitler threatened that the bishop would suffer once the Axis had won the war.

TI  - Aborting Sex: Gay Rights as an Anti-Life Movement
AU  - Sullins, D Paul
AB  - Gay rights is not generally considered a life issue. But the social and cultural effects of same-sex sexual expression are remarkably similar to those of induced abortion. Like contraception, both contravene the natural operation of the body in order to conform human sexuality to the ideals of modernity – including unconditioned personal expression, availability to industrial capitalism, and reduced uncertainty in the life course. By severing the link between sex and children, both increase privatization, diminish the social intentionality and form of the sexual union, and undermine the unitive good and the transcendent goal of marriage. Movements for both gay rights and abortion rights employ similar rhetoric and share activist personnel, and gay rights activists strategically promote affinity with abortion rights. Unless proponents of human life engage such alignments on the cultural level, overcoming insularity and a narrow focus, direct issue engagement on abortion and on homosexuality risks becoming incoherent and counterproductive.

AB  - In modern times, the secular environmental movement seems to have taken on an anti-life message, in ways both subtle and direct. This anti-human – and often anti-life – view has crept into the heart of the “mainstream” ecological movement with consequences that can be detrimental to both human dignity and to the environment itself. This essay does not aim to analyze the complexities inherent in economic development, demographic predictions, or climatology. Instead, it is a call to reflect carefully and soberly on the troubling moral consequences of grounding respect for the environment in disrespect for the dignity of the human person. The first part of the essay outlines the ways in which the ecological movement has run into conflict with pro-life values. This includes a discussion of both the anti-life rhetoric of the ecological movement and illustrative environmental policies that may have a detrimental effect on human life. The second part of the discussion sets forth the essential components of a pro-life vision of environmental responsibility and explores how the pro-life movement can enhance and renew the ecological movement.

AB  - The Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, a broad-ranging reform of America’s healthcare system, the Patients Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in March 2010. The bill nearly failed to pass the Congress, however, because of concerns about its possible anti-life effects. In the end, pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives, whose votes were essential to passage of PPACA, accepted President Obama’s promise to ensure PPACA was not anti-life. This article will (1) critically examine the process by which PPACA was passed, and (2) evaluate whether the “compromise” that emerged to save the bill respected pro-life concerns. The material in this article was presented to UFL in June 2010. Subsequently, there have been a number of developments –particularly with the implementation of the reform and with the content and enforcement of the “preventive services” mandate – that are not chronicled in this article.

TI  - The Fourteenth Amendment Right of Conscience: Roe, Casey, and the Constitutional Right to Refuse
AU  - Rienzi, Mark L
AB  - Supreme Court precedents in Roe and Casey establish a pregnant woman’s right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion. Do those same precedents also protect her doctor’s right to decide whether to perform abortions? The Fourteenth Amendment rights of various parties in the abortion context – the pregnant woman, the fetus, the fetus’s father, the state – have been discussed at length by commentators and the courts. Surprisingly, the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the physician asked to perform the abortion have rarely been explored. The Court’s substantive due process analysis typically looks for rights that are “deeply rooted” in our history and traditions. Accordingly, this article addresses the historical basis for finding that physicians do indeed have a Fourteenth Amendment right to refuse to perform abortions. Ultimately, this historical analysis shows that the right to refuse actually has better historical support, and better satisfies the Court’s stated tests, than the abortion right itself. A physician’s right to make this decision without government compulsion also fits squarely within the zone of individual decision-making protected by the Court’s opinions in Casey and Lawrence v. Texas, and protects physicians from the types of psychological harm that the Court recognized in Roe and Casey. For these reasons, under Roe and Casey, a physician has a Fourteenth Amendment right to refuse to perform abortions.

TI  - A Comment on “The Constitutional Law and Politics of Reproductive Rights”
AU  - Myers, Richard S
AB  - One of the most interesting things about current legal scholarship is the continuing flow of articles re-evaluating Roe v. Wade. For example, in 2009 the Yale Law Journal published several essays from a conference that dealt with “The Constitutional Law and Politics of Reproductive Rights.” These essays were all from the perspective of those favoring abortion rights. I think these articles are quite instructive for prolife scholars. This paper reflects upon the principal lessons revealed through a careful reading of this scholarship. The articles indicate that Roe and Casey are still in play; these cases are not a settled part of the legal landscape. The articles, which typically suggest that the current law only protects a rather modest right to an abortion, also indicate that there is a continuing need to describe the current legal situation accurately. There is also a need to continue to focus on the harms of abortion – the harm to the unborn, of course, but also the harm to women. The articles also reflect a desire to move away from a focus on the courts. I think that is a sign of weakness for pro-choice academics, but it also reflects the importance of trying to promote a culture of life while at the same time trying to change the law. There has been progress in both areas. The prolife legal movement has made modest and important gains over the last two decades and there is an increasing pro-life sentiment in the broader culture. In sum, reflecting upon these articles leaves me with a sense of optimism about the long-range objective of building a culture of life.

AU  - Hammond, J. Daniel
T2  - Journal of the History of Economic Thought
AB  - Fr. John A. Ryan, in his day a staunch promoter of the minimum wage as an important application of the principles of Catholic Social Teaching, held many positions that aligned him with advocates of social reform who advocated for radical stances on many topics. But his reliance on the ancient Christian doctrine of the dignity and sacredness of each person preserved him from wandering into the excess of eugenics. Many of those who rejected or ignored this understanding of the dignity of each individual were not so fortunate.

TI  - Methods and Resources for Teaching Bioethics to Nurses
AU  - Freres, Barbara
AB  - In considering methods and resources for teaching bioethics to nurses, I do two things in this article. First, I locate the discipline of bioethics historically and describe what seems to me to be its most common manifestation in colleges and universities presently educating students in the medical professions. Second, I argue that a course in biomedical ethics, though an applied branch of the philosophical discipline of ethics, is enriched and made more effective if its students are encouraged to consider the dignity of the human person in the light of both reason and faith. While considering the diversity of the student populations that many of us face in teaching our courses, I make reference to two works that can enhance an understanding of that dignity with respect to both beginning and end of life issues.

TI  - Defending the Argument from Potential
AU  - Eberl, Jason T
AB  - I argue that the Aristotelian concept of potentiality, when applied to analyzing the ontological status of human embryos and fetuses, supports the conclusion that embryos and fetuses are not “potential persons,” but rather “persons with potential.” That is, embryos and fetuses possess an intrinsic active potentiality to develop themselves, within a supportive environment, into more fully actualized self-conscious and rational beings. I then defend this argument against criticisms from Alto Charo and Louis Guenin concerning embryos in light of the realities of in vitro fertilization and the possibility of human cloning, and from Jeff McMahan regarding the status of cognitively deficient fetuses. I conclude by discussing how my conclusion for the ontological status of embryos and fetuses as persons from conception provides a rationale, even if it does not logically entail, recognizing them to have the moral status we accord to born persons, including a fundamental right to life.

TI  - Vulnerability, Dependence and Abortion: A Reply to J.J. Thomson
AU  - Coulter, G J
AB  - Judith Jarvis Thomson’s “A Defense of Abortion” imprinted pro-choice thinking for a generation and continues to exert influence over contemporary pro-choice culture. To a large measure it is Thomson’s remarkable analogies that explain this sustained interest. They illustrate moral intuitions that appear to support abortion for all sorts of reasons, most of which have nothing to do with safeguarding the mother. No doubt her popularity comes from her conception of the origins of moral obligations, viz., that obligations only come from our informed and free consent to them. If a woman has not consented to becoming pregnant, she has no obligation to provide care for her unborn fetus. Thomson thinks that there is only a short step to justifying abortion. I respond to Thomson by examining two of her most compelling cases – the “violinist” and “people seeds” arguments. I offer counter-analogies that exemplify alternate moral principles regarding our obligations toward others.

AU  - Gardiner, Anne Barbeau
AB  - In this essay I shall look at the writings of two men who broke new ground in promoting the culture of death. Both died in 2003 and both are still highly regarded in academe: (1) Garrett Hardin, a biologist who taught Human Ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, worked actively in the 1960s for the legalization of abortion and for population control for ecology’s sake. (2) James Rachels, a philosopher and medical ethicist at the University of Alabama, merited praise in The New York Times for having launched the campaign for euthanasia by denying the difference between killing and letting die. Both men may be called post-human because they grounded their support for the culture of death on contempt for the human race–Hardin reduced us to numbers, while Rachels leveled us with beasts. That both men rose to the top of their fields shows how secular academe today encourages post-human perspectives.

TI  - Catholic Feminist Ethics and the Culture of Death:
AU  - Gardiner, Anne Barbeau
AB  - In her recent book Just Love, Sister Margaret Farley makes so-called “women’s experience” the basis for a radical new “sexual ethics.” She promotes an upper-class feminist ideology while censuring the Catholic Church for promulgating an ethics that is not universal but only a masculine construct. Ever since 1973, Farley has been a leading and consistent apologist for the Culture of Death, but in the year 2000, in her presidential address to the Catholic Theological Society of America, she openly confronted and blamed the Magisterium for standing on a narrow ground in its repeated condemnations of abortion. And yet her writings and those of other Catholic feminists in her wake reveal that it is these dissidents themselves who stand on a narrow ground in their defense of abortion. Their embrace of “women’s experience” as an ideology has led directly to Farley’s Just Love, a work that condones not just abortion but also masturbation, pornography, adultery, and active homosexuality.

TI  - The Doubling Undone? Double Effect in Recent Medical Ethics
AU  - Garcia, J L A
AB  - This article treats recent bioethical discussions of double effect reasoning (DER) by offering a summary account of DER and construing it as rooted in a sensible view of what is central to someone’s identity as a moral agent. It then treats objections raised in recent years by Judith Thomson, Alison McIntyre, and Frances Kamm against familiar ways of applying DER to certain controversies within medical ethics, especially that over physicianassisted suicide. After detailing, interpreting, and attempting to rebut the challenges from these philosophers, who are especially interesting because their criticisms of DER come from allies in DER’s struggle against consequentialist reasoning, the essay engages DER’s contribution to a recent dispute over treatment of patients in what is called “persistent vegetative state.” Near its end, the paper sketches several possible points of entry to DER and sources of justification for it. The essay concludes by indicating a connection between these paths and its opening idea of moral identity.

Here, his announced aim is to cast doubt on any such unconditional duty of physicians because of both “the way in which physicians’ duties arise” and also “the moral weight of countervailing duties.” I will show that each of these arguments fails for several reasons, that his discussion manifests a number of additional defects, and that his position relies on dubious and undefended assumptions that, once accepted, threaten to legitimate moral enormities perhaps more outrageous than physician-performed euthanasia itself.

TI  - Does International Law Protect the Unborn Child?
AU  - Flood, Patrick J
AB  - In the debate on whether international law upholds an unborn child’s right to live or, conversely, a pregnant woman’s right to abort, this essay argues that the weight of the evidence in the relevant universal and regional legal instruments supports the former view. In addition to direct references to unborn life in some agreements, several instruments also call for certain kinds of state action that by their nature provide practical protection for the unborn child’s life. In short, the conclusion is that the available evidence points more often, more clearly, and with more weight to a preference for life. This is true of both universal agreements and all but one of the several regional human rights instruments. However, the new Protocol on Women’s Rights in Africa contains a paragraph on abortion that, while unsupported by other parts of that text as well as by universal and other African instruments, nonetheless represents a departure from the general pattern. The essay therefore analyzes the Protocol at somewhat greater length and suggests several ways to address its unusual provision on abortion. Finally, the essay outlines three concrete proposals to clarify, strengthen and complement existing international provisions for protection of unborn human life: (1) An African Protocol on the Rights of the Unborn Child, (2) A UN Declaration on the Protection of Unborn Children, and (3) Appointment by the Human Rights Council of a Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Unborn Children.

AU  - Ohlendorf, Jennifer
AB  - The CDC has conducted the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) every three to seven years between 1973 and 2002 to describe contraceptive use among women in the U.S. The data from these surveys are available to researchers to examine trends in contraceptive use and sexual behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine data from the 2002 NSFG in order to determine the influence of religiosity on abortion and abortifacient contraceptive use, i.e., the use of the oral contraceptive pill (OC), the injected hormone Depoprovera (IC), the IU D , and hormonal emergency contraception (EC), among American women between the ages of 15-44. The NSFG is a population-based selection of 7,676 women. The 2002 data set contains variables on whether the woman had ever used abortion, the above methods of family planning, and variables on the importance of religion, church attendance, and attitudes on sexuality. We found (based on statistical odds ratios) that those women who viewed religion as very important attended church frequently (i.e., at least once a week) and held traditional attitudes on religion were less likely to have had an abortion in the past twelve months and less likely to use OCs, ICs, and ECs. There was no difference in the likelihood of ever having used IUDs. We concluded that religiosity has a suppressing effect on abortion and abortifacient contraceptive use.

In this paper I will provide evidence that breastfeeding does not induce early pregnancy loss and that it is not the moral equivalent to the administration of abortifacient-type drugs.

Prolife activists aggressively campaigned for Proposition 85 in the name of child protection and of parental rights to know. The author contends that support for such regulations on abortion in the name of other rights ignores the rights of the unborn and therefore the issue of justice as central to abortion and the political situation. The abandonment of justice as an operative principle is of particular importance to confessional communities that hold that intrinsic injustice should not be institutionalized in the public square. An Appendix addresses the support of Proposition 85 by the Catholic Bishops of California.

The three problems that I touch on are: a neglect of the role of God in human procreation, a neglect of the dignity of women, and a neglect of understanding personal being.

AB  - From Euripides’s ancient tragedy Medea to the contemporary story of Roe v. Wade, Western civilization has seen accounts of women’s suffering and exploitation in the name of “choice.” A recent article in The New York Times by Emily Bazelon is yet another recapitulation of this saga. Bazelon’s use of ad hominem rhetoric and inconclusive data as well as her constant misuse of data allow no indication that even one woman may have been affected negatively by an abortion. This paper will argue that post- abortion disorder does exist. Epidemiological and clinical data are cited, as well as research conducted by pro-choice doctors. The article finds that Bazelon is so ideologically committed to Roe v. Wade that she is more interested in protecting the law than the women for whom the law was written. In her article we see the tired and worn rhetoric of an ideological take on reality that stands in complete contrast to the needs of women who are suffering.

The court’s majority opinion blatantly ignored the uncontroverted evidence of the personhood of the unborn in medicine, in law, and in literature already extant prior to the adoption of “personhood” protection in the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, from the standpoint of language and logical analysis, the legal separation of “human beings” from “persons” is artificial and arbitrary.

AB  - In 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade ushered in the wholesale destruction of unborn children. Pro-lifers quickly realized that the basis for this decision would spawn further degeneration of the principle that all innocent human life is sacred. In recent years the relativism of this jurisprudence has extended to assisted suicide, euthanasia, and organ-harvesting from those who have not yet died. This paper recounts the experience of a lawyer who has handled cases in this area over many years. It argues that the only chance for adequate protection of patients requires that a person have both a wellarticulated healthcare proxy and a pro-life living will.

The paper articulates an account of medicine as a profession and asks how conscientious objection comports with medical professionalism. It presents the general features of a professional conscience clause. In particular, it develops the grounds for and the limits to conscientious objection to referral. Any coherent account of objection must include the ability to object to referring a patient. Instances in which the objecting practitioner has allowed the patient to develop a reliance, however, limit conscientious objection. The paper concludes with an articulation of the duties of the conscientious objector such as the promulgation of one’s objection, preservation of confidentiality in instances of objection, and full disclosure.

TI  - “Partial-Birth Abortion” Is Not Abortion: Carhart II’s Fundamental Misapplication of Roe
AU  - Calhoun, Samuel W
AB  - In explaining his constitutional objection to Wisconsin’s partial-birth abortion ban, Judge Richard Posner contrasts killing during “normal labor” with partial-birth abortion. The former can be constitutionally prohibited, but the latter cannot. Why the distinction? For Posner, the former involves “killing a live baby that is half-born,” whereas the latter does not. This article will show that Judge Posner is correct to assert that killing a baby in the midst of the birth process is not constitutionally protected. But Judge Posner is wrong to say that partial-birth abortion does not kill “a live baby that is half-born.” This article will demonstrate that the partial-birth procedure in fact does kill a baby during its birth. Ban-proponents are correct in their long-standing argument that the partial-birth procedure is not really an abortion. Consequently, Roe, properly understood, is inapplicable to partial-birth abortion bans. Courts, however, including the U.S. Supreme Court in Carhart II, have nonetheless routinely used the analytical framework of Roe and Casey to evaluate bans. This common mistake undermines current partial-birth abortion jurisprudence. The rational basis test, not Roe/Casey, is the proper evaluative tool. Using the correct standard could have significant consequences for future challenges to the federal ban and to the bans of the various states.

AB  - This essay replies to the claim that the ANT-OAR procedure creates disabled human embryos. It focuses upon the chief locus of disagreement between defenders and opponents, which is the identity of the product of the procedure immediately after nuclear transfer and before and during nuclear reprogramming. Whereas opponents believe that the biological entity that carries out the nuclear reprogramming is a human embryo, this essay argues that such a conclusion is scientifically and philosophically untenable. It argues rather that the efficient cause of nuclear reprogramming is an unnatural ooplast-somatic cell hybrid, a biological construct not found in nature, whose active bodily potencies never exceed those of the vegetative order. Because a principal capacity of the cell at its origin is to convert itself, through a process of nuclear reprogramming, into a stem cell, it is reasonable to consider the product of nuclear transfer before and during reprogramming a stem cell.

AB  - Determinations of death made by physicians are clinical judgments, but nonetheless judgments involving metaphysical realities, the passing of persons from this life. Current controversy about the validity of neurological criteria for determining death suggests the need for careful study of anthropological reasoning as well as medical data. This article proposes charity and wisdom as a theological context for the use of such neurological criteria. These concepts clarify what it means to relieve burdens to patients, family, and caregivers and to promote organ transplantation while refusing the direct killing of patients. A question remains whether neurological criteria suffice or should be related to signs in other parts of the body. This article defends in part the argument of Edward J. Furton for the validity of neurological criteria but argues that at least in some cases signs of life and death from other bodily systems should be regarded.

The effect of this metaphysic on society has been a loss of respect for those who are weak by the strong, and liberal polities have sacrificed their founding principle that all life should be treated as equal because they have forgotten that being depends not on what is passing but on what is always.

AU  - Anadale, Christopher
AU  - Bruecken, Albert
AB  - Opponents of the 2006 Missouri cloning amendment failed by a narrow margin to defeat it. Rhetorical missteps played a key role in this loss, as did early failures to alter biased ballot language. Traditional pro-life arguments about the dignity of the embryo proved less effective than constitutional objections to the specifics of the proposed amendment. In this article we review the rhetorical strategies used by both sides in the campaign, summarize the election results and aftermath, and make recommendations for future political battles.

TI  - Gonzales v. Carhart: Abortion Law that Looks Like Family Law
AU  - Alvaré, Helen M
AB  - The U.S. Supreme Court’s most recent abortion opinion, Gonzales v. Carhart, upheld a ban on the “partial-birth” abortion procedure. Incorporated into the language and reasoning of the Court’s opinion were two presumptions about parent-child relationships found commonly in “family law” but not in “abortion law.” The first is the presumption that it is good to preserve the natural bonds between parents and their biological children. The second is that children are relatively vulnerable as compared with adults and merit protection from the State when warranted. The author contrasts the themes and language in pre-Gonzales abortion law with the family law of parent-child relations. She then describes the Gonzales Court’s move to adopt family law presumptions, and suggests reasons for the Court’s move. Finally, she discusses possible additional changes in federal and state abortion laws and policies that the Gonzales decision could facilitate.

AU  - Adams, Jeffrey R
AU  - Adams, Karen K
AB  - Uganda faces pressure by the West to accept reproductive technology, especially elective abortion, as the answer to the challenges of human sexuality. This pressure is well represented by the 2006 publication Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Uganda. We offer a response and a call to take seriously the coherent philosophical position represented by the general rejection of abortion and other reproductive technologies in Uganda. We first examine the current legal and moral status of abortion in that country. We then compare the notion of freedom represented by Unintended Pregnancy with a thicker notion of freedom being worked out in Uganda, one that we believe offers a fairer understanding of the traditional and contemporary religious culture of Ugandans and that better addresses the many societal issues related to sexuality that impinge on the freedom and dignity of Ugandan women.

TI  - The Moral Status of the Oocyte
AU  - Zenarolla, Kimberly
AB  - With the rise of reproductive technologies, women’s bodies have come to be seen in a new light. Rather than considering the whole woman as essential to the act of conception and gestation, an atomistic and mechanized notion of the oocyte as a tool in generating a child has arisen. Cloning technologies have further reinforced this view by “disassembling” the “parts” of the ovum (removing its nucleus) in order to insert genetic material required to generate new (albeit, cloned) life. Genetic engineering will inevitably focus on the ovum as science seeks to control all aspects of generation. It is imperative that we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the oocyte in relationship to the woman as bearer of life. Rather than viewing the egg as an object of manipulation, we need to consider its value, and whether this necessarily has ethical implications.

AB  - This essay analyzes the conflict between two major public philosophies that compete to be the public philosophy of the United States: contemporary “antiperfectionist” liberalism and natural law liberalism. After describing contemporary liberal public philosophy, especially by reference to the thought of its most influential figure, John Rawls, the essay comments on some of the inadequacies of Rawlsian public philosophy, particularly with respect to abortion. It then gives an account of the core principles and tendencies of liberalism and shows why natural law theory can and should embrace these core principles and tendencies, even while directing and elevating them. Finally, it applies this “natural law liberalism” to contemporary life issues.

AU  - Wardle, Lynn D
AB  - Each generation must rediscover the foundational principles upon which our democracy is built, including respect for rights of conscience. ACOG Opinion No. 385 is moderate in tone and recognizes the ethical dilemma of physicians with conscience objections to patient requests for controversial provisions. However, the substance of the Opinion is biased against rights of conscience, presents a weakened version of the physicians’ right-of-conscience position, assumes away the real dilemmas, presents ethical arguments for only one side of the issue, and portrays the controversy as a toggle-switch matter, fails to consider many relevant considerations and alternative solutions, and is conclusory throughout. The history of the settling of America and the founding of our nation show the importance of protecting rights of conscience. The Founders viewed conscience as protected by right, not by tolerance. The First Amendment was intended to protect rights of conscience. By fostering virtue, protecting conscience protects our constitutional liberties.

TI  - Abortion and Emily Dickinson: Sex, Religion and Romanticism in the Marriage Group Poems
AU  - Ward, Bernadette Waterman
AB  - William Shurr claimed that adultery with Rev. Charles Wadsworth, followed by abortion, gave Emily Dickinson poetic depth. His historically and psychologically improbable misinterpretation of the passionate language common in her correspondence, and of her poetry, stems from a hostility to an embodied rather than a “sovereign” self. The attitude was an attitude fashionable among literary critics in the late twentieth century. In many of her religious poems Dickinson did manifest, even cherish, rejection and despair, and she asserted a rebellious self. But her erotic poems celebrate fulfillment rather than abstinence. Her religious poems abandon a spirituality of denial and absence as they center on Christ the Bridegroom and embrace a regal identity as “wife.” She was hampered in this escape from the sovereign self by a sola scriptura Calvinism and aided by the Romantic approach to the intercourse between the imagination and the world.

AB  - Already an important poet as the Romantic movement began, Anna Letitia Barbauld inspired poets like Coleridge. She supported extending suffrage, religious toleration, elimination of slavery, and revolutions in France and America. She broke ground for the Romantics as to subject matter. Overshadowed by major Romantic theorists from the late nineteenth century until critics rediscovered her in the late twentieth century, she aroused ambivalence in feminists. They misread her satire on critics of women’s rights. Contemporary students are attracted by her poetry asserting the dignity of the expectant mother and the child in the womb. Barbauld’s careful rhetorical work elevates the dignity of motherhood—a form of radicalism in her day. Her work roused my students because she defends pregnancy, which is attacked in the media that they encounter.

AB  - The goals of those in government and healthcare include expanding access to abortion. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have circumvented many state laws restricting abortion by allowing telemedicine chemical abortions without a clinic in-person visit by the teen or woman. These recommendations are based on studies on telemedicine abortions in the U.S., which show minimum side effects from medication abortions. The data upon which this is based is in sharp contrast to European studies, which show significant morbidity for the patient, even with a physical exam, ultrasound, screening, and treatment for STDs and in-person follow-up. States need to ban telemedicine abortions without an in-person visit, including a pelvic exam and pelvic ultrasound. Key words: Abortion, medication abortion, chemical abortion, telemedicine abortion, complications of chemical and medical abortions.

TI  - The Constitutionality of Laws Banning Down Syndrome Abortions
AU  - Myers, Richard S
AB  - Laws banning abortions that are sought because the unborn child is thought to have Down syndrome are increasingly common. The constitutionality of these bans on so-called trait-selection abortions has been challenged in the courts, and the courts have reached conflicting results. This paper explores these constitutional issues. Under the existing constitutional framework set forth by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. , these bans are likely unconstitutional. This conclusion further reveals the constitutional and moral deficiencies in the Supreme Court’s current approach. These bans on what are called eugenic abortions are, however, serving a useful purpose. They highlight the reality that abortion takes the life of a human being, and they do so in the context of abortions that are difficult for abortion rights advocates to defend. These bans, which reveal how extreme the Court’s current approach is, are helping to prompt a rethinking of Roe and Casey.

TI  - “He hath made Himself...weak enough, now into the world to come”: The Embryo Christ in Lancelot Andrewes and John Donne
AU  - Kenney, Theresa
AB  - In the seventeenth century in England, prominent members of the Church of England held views on the humanity of the child in the womb in tune with those of modern pro-lifers. We see these views partly through their preaching on the nature of the Christ Child in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes’s considerations of the Incarnation included teachings on the Christ Child in the womb, from his conception by the Holy Spirit to his birth. These observations can illuminate the belief of John Donne, his younger and more famous contemporary, in the Christ Child’s omniscience in the womb. The two men inherited a long tradition of Christian belief in the full humanity of the child in the womb, and in the full divinity of the Christ Child when he was an embryo. This essay focuses on Andrewes’s Christmas sermon on the subject and Donne’s poem from his La Corona sonnets, which he might have written right before or right after his conversion from Catholicism to the Anglican church. Both men demonstrate their belief in the pre-born Christ’s salvific power and intent.

TI  - How Not to Defend the Unborn
AU  - Hershenov, David
AU  - Reed, Philip A
AB  - It is sometimes proposed that killing or harming abortion providers is the only logically consistent position available to opponents of abortion. Since lethal violence against morally responsible attackers is normally viewed as justified in order to defend innocent parties, pro-lifers should also think so in the case of the abortion doctor, and so they should act to defend the unborn. In our paper, we defend the mainstream pro-life view against killing abortion doctors. We argue that the pro-life view can, in various ways, reject the assumption that defensive violence to save innocent individuals is always permissible. Now even if that assumption is accepted, we contend that defensive violence against abortion doctors still is not justified. Drawing on Frances Kamm’s work, we contend that there are structural similarities between abortion and letting someone die who needs your help to stay alive; and we argue that it is impermissible to kill those who kill in order to avoid giving life-saving aid.

TI  - Half a Century of Strife: The Abortion Controversy’s Inescapable Centrality in Modern American History
AU  - Cassidy, Keith
AB  - The abortion controversy has been a central feature of American society for half a century. The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v Wade, far from resolving a growing issue, nationalized it, made it difficult to legislate even minimal compromises, and was seen as an exercise in raw judicial power, lacking legitimacy. It enormously energized and enlarged the nascent right to life movement which became one of the most notable social movements in American history. The movement has been characterized by its diversity, grassroots activism and endurance in the face of constant vilification. The relative stability of public attitudes to abortion of the period is proof of its impact. It has been a major factor in American politics. Recent attempts to minimize the extreme and destructive character of the Roe decision are unpersuasive. Clarke Forsythe’s Abuse of Discretion is highly recommended for those who wish to understand the decision and its consequences.

It then provides a critical response to the book from a pro-life point of view. It argues that Kamitsuka’s interpretation of history in relation to abortion is false, misleading, and incomplete. Her philosophical arguments in defense of the killing of the inhabitant of the womb are gravely faulty because they rely on othering, which is a phenomenon that is wellunderstood and critiqued in other areas of human life but one that goes unrecognized by pro-choice advocates when they themselves are guilty of it. The evil in the pro-choice position lies principally in its indefensible violence, which in turn produces a cultural atmosphere characterized by rancor, spiritual ugliness, and emotional pain.

AB  - Showing us a society in which questions about life issues cannot be asked, non-Christian Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go vivifies the prophetic observations of Evangelium vitae. Ishiguro immerses readers in the interrelation of technological threats to the family and to undefended lives. Despair rises from untruths about family and sexuality. The protagonists surrender to homicidal and suicidal meaninglessness. Both texts preach the sacredness of every being that comes from human ancestry, powerfully indicting the passion for power in biotechnology that overshadows the truth inscribed in the body. Although the novel makes the truths of Evangelium vitae painfully vivid, almost all its critics evade attending to the interrelated life issues in a way that curiously echoes the very accusation about complicity and falsehood that is at the heart of the novel’s cultural critique.

Casey and (2) the Court's rejection of the inviolability of all human life. Although the constitutional law in the United States on abortion and assisted suicide has been relatively stable for decades, the issues are still subject to debate. The debate will likely continue for many years. As the debate continues, we would do well to seriously consider the views articulated in Evangelium vitae.

TI  - Aborted Human Fetal Tissue in Vaccines: Ethical and Legal Considerations amid the Race to a COVID-19 Vaccine
AU  - MacPherson, Ryan C
AB  - For over fifty years, aborted human fetal tissue has been instrumental to the development and mass production of vaccines commonly administered to children. Several candidates in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine also utilize aborted human fetal tissue cell lines. Leading scientists involved in vaccine development openly affirm the dependency of their medical breakthroughs upon aborted (even vivisected) human fetuses and defend this practice by appealing to utilitarian ethics. Informed consent, both as an ethical principle and as a legal guarantee, generally affords competent adults the right to conscientiously refuse medical treatment and, to some degree, the right also to refuse on behalf of their minor children. Although the Jacobson (1905) ruling strongly favors the state’s authority to mandate vaccination, subsequent developments in fundamental rights jurisprudence should tilt the balance in favor of conscientious pro-life objections to abortion-derived vaccines. In the context of a pandemic emergency, however, the exercise of those rights may entail involuntary isolation or quarantine for thirty days or longer. In addition to asserting the rights to conscience, religious liberty, and bodily integrity, those who object to receiving an abortion-derived vaccine would also do well to expose the false assumption that nothing but a vaccine can protect the population against contagious disease.

At the outset, the article explains that there is very little evidence that the Supreme Court, as presently constituted, would be willing to overrule Roe. The article next observes that the multiple state challenges to Roe that have been brought over the past few years have been largely ineffective, both in limiting when or why abortions may be performed and in obtaining Supreme Court review. The article explains why a “test case” involving a statute that clearly conflicts with Roe is not necessary for the Court to reconsider Roe. Finally, the article addresses the importance of state constitutions as they may affect the legal status of abortion in the event the Supreme Court overrules Roe and returns the issue of abortion to the States.

AU  - Lemmons, R Mary Hayden
AB  - History can serve as a test of various philosophical notions. In the twenty-five years since John Paul II published Evangelium vitae, his analysis of the individual and cultural factors responsible for the killing of embryos via abortifacients, fetuses via abortion, and the dying via euthanasia has proven prescient. It is thus time to consider his remedies for countering the culture of death and promoting the culture of life. These remedies revolve around the person, the family, and socio-political activism. For John Paul II, the hub around which the culture of life and the culture of death both revolve is the human person, but the culture of life promotes more rewarding personal fulfillment. The key aspect of this fulfillment comes through exercising spousal love in families constituted either through marriage or through a relationship to God and the human family. The indispensability of families for personal fulfillment requires social and political activism in order to defend the person and build the culture of life.

The solution proceeds on this model: example, invitation, accompaniment, repetition. After pointing to well-known practitioners such as Mother Teresa, I suggest some ways in which university faculty members might use the model to contribute to a culture of pro-life virtue.

AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - This paper considers the implications of Pope Saint John Paul II’s encyclical Evangelium vitae (The Gospel of Life) for the use, teaching, and research of natural family planning (NFP). In this encyclical the pope analyzed the connections between use of contraception and abortion, encouraged the development of NFP centers, advised that NFP be provided to all married couples, urged health care professionals to be involved in teaching NFP, and recommended that universities be involved with research in NFP, especially to explicate NFP’s effectiveness. This paper provides evidence for the association of contraception with abortion, for the state of NFP among married couples in the United States, and gives examples of NFP centers that focus on women’s health. This paper also presents evidence for the effectiveness of NFP in helping couples to avoid and achieve pregnancy. In light of the pope’s call for universities to be involved with building a culture of life, this paper explains the Marquette University Institute for NFP as doing so through educating health care professionals in how to teach the Marquette Model system of NFP, by conducting NFP research, and by offering innovative NFP services. The paper ends echoing John Paul II’s call for women to be leaders in developing a culture of life by discussing ways health care professional women have promoted NFP through social media, the internet, innovative technology, and women’s health services.

The theological symbolism, which O’Connor specifically endorsed, does not exhaust the meaning in her use of disabled characters. They are not allegorical figures. She writes quite intentionally in the mode of realism. Her disabled characters are human beings as fully in need of redemption as those with wider ranges of capability, and especially in her novel, The Violent Bear It Away. She presents that full humanity as a rebuke to the utilitarianism that is philosophically foundational to a culture that devalues the lives of people with disabilities.

Philosophically, Wojty³a’s Thomistic analysis of the ontological ground from which free and deliberate, self-communicative human actions issue gives us a firm basis both for affirming the personhood of human beings who lack, or who have lost, the ability to perform such actions, and for recognizing other modes of activity by which these same persons nevertheless communicate themselves as persons to others, as they strive inwardly toward achieving fully personal selfcommunication in action. After having explored this, the paper considers Wojty³a/John Paul’s understanding of unborn and suffering/disabled persons, indicating how his philosophical anthropology undergirds, and is complemented by, his explicitly theological understanding of these persons and their agency. To conclude, the paper shows how today’s “culture of death” inverts the key principles on which Wojty³a/John Paul’s Christian humanism rests.

TI  - Liberty Finds No Refuge: The Doubt-Filled Future of Casey’s Undue Burden Standard
AU  - Molony, Thomas J
AB  - Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court raises serious questions about the continuing vitality of the Court’s decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. But a new justice on the Court is not the only reason that there is doubt surrounding a woman’s ability to choose. Two years before Justice Kennedy retired, the Court introduced a great deal of uncertainty into its abortion jurisprudence in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. In Hellerstedt, the Court interpreted Casey’s undue burden standard to require a court to balance an abortion regulation’s benefits against its burdens in assessing the regulation’s constitutionality, leading Justice Clarence Thomas to accuse the majority of “reimagining” Casey’s standard in a way that “will surely mystify lower courts for years to come.” Whether the newly constituted Court will solve this mystery remains to be seen. In the meantime, lower courts must determine what Casey’s undue burden standard demands. And as states continue to experiment with new abortion-related measures and challenges are brought against regulations – both new and old – a coherent structure for applying the undue burden test is an urgent need.

TI  - Professing the Gift of Life: Responding to Requests for Genetic Testing in Early Pregnancy
AU  - Miller, Kevin E
AB  - Healthcare providers have two reasons to be cautious about offering early prenatal genetic testing, for it is now the “standard of care” and something desired by many parents. (1) Doing so can easily constitute proximate material cooperation with the great evil of abortion. (2) More deeply, and even when parents are not abortion-minded, it can be at odds with the great good of human life, understood as a pure gift from God the Creator. Providers should therefore make such testing available only when it is specifically needed to offer better care if a baby is found to have a genetic anomaly. They should adhere to this limit even if it might involve conscientious objection to the policies of “professional” bodies or of the state, and they should be prepared to offer parents some psychological and spiritual assistance in coping with their uncertainties and fears.

TI  - The “Culture of Death” as a “Structure of Sin”
AU  - Miller, Kevin E
AB  - In his 1995 Evangelium vitae Pope John Paul II teaches that our culture of death is, among other things, a “structure of sin.” This essay inquires into the meaning of this term in the thought of the Second Vatican Council and of John Paul II and explains its applicability to a culture in which abortion, euthanasia (even if “only” voluntary), and the like are commonplace. I argue that culture should be thought of as a matter-form composite. A culture of death is one that has been malformed by, for instance, an individualistic conception of the human person. For this reason it has a material element that includes pressures and inducements to participate in sins against human life. It follows that our task is to persuade our culture to respect human life for the right reasons, which requires in turn evangelization of our culture.

TI  - The Disabled in Locke and Aquinas: Impediments to Economic Liberty or Contributors to the Economy of Salvation?
AU  - Manchester, Eric
AB  - While both the late-seventeenth-century philosopher John Locke and the thirteenth-century thinker Thomas Aquinas believe that the rational human soul must be directly created by God, the two men define freedom in fundamentally different ways, which in turn influence their differing conceptions of the human person. By defining freedom primarily as the ability to overcome inconvenience and uneasiness and by defining personhood in terms of being able to rationally engage in political and economic activity, Locke’s approach lends itself to neglecting (and in some cases perhaps even ending the existence of) disabled and infirm individuals as well as possibly certain unborn offspring. They are regarded as lacking freedom in being unable to overcome uneasiness. Their existence seems an inconvenience that hampers the freedom of others. By comparison, Thomas regards all human offspring as being necessarily persons. Whatever their disabilities, their nature orients them toward eternal communion with God and others. Locke divides the social and religious ends of human persons, with socio-economic considerations driving his understanding of personhood in both cases. By comparison, Aquinas conceives of both social and ecclesial life as being infused by sacramental participation and as thereby oriented toward eternal sacramental communion with God. In his case, through the sacraments, all people – including the disabled and the unborn – are not only oriented toward their own salvation but play a profound (if in some cases inscrutable) role in the salvation of the whole world.

I suggest that the best way to understand how a marriage as a whole should be “open to life” requires us to think about marriage through the virtues tradition, with a particular emphasis on the natural virtue of piety.

AB  - The first part of this essay examines the assumptions that led states to enact laws identifying death with the brain’s inability to function. The second part argues that survivors of brain death prove the neurological definition of death to be a legal fiction. The third part explains why it is possible to survive a brain death diagnosis and evaluates the argument that death needs to be redefined in order to accommodate the role of brain death in harvesting organs for transplantation. The fourth part criticizes philosophical pro-brain death arguments and argues that states ought to adopt the religious exemption enacted by the state of New Jersey, rather than the religious accommodation policy enacted by New York State. The essay concludes by arguing that justice demands that states repeal the laws identifying death with the brain’s inability to function. Until then the legalization of brain death threatens the living and inculcates values antithetical to caring for the vulnerable among us.

TI  - Critical Disability Studies and Fiction on the Right-to-Life Issues
AU  - Koloze, Jeff
AB  - After supplying examples of jargon-laden academic discussion of critical disability studies, this paper summarizes major ideas that constitute this literary theory. Two life-affirming fictional works that concern abortion and infanticide (Carlos Fuentes’s Christopher Unborn and Lois Lowry’s The Giver) are then briefly examined, using key ideas from the theory. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to applying critical disability studies to a euthanasia work (the Million Dollar Baby franchise, consisting of the short story and its film equivalent). The discussions of these three works are amplified by providing further commentary from a pro-life perspective. Finally, the paper determines how the principles of critical disability studies comport with the five elements of right-to-life literary theory and demonstrates how critical disability studies is compatible with the aims of the pro-life movement, which counters the dehumanization of the disabled in anti-life fiction.

In Laudato Sí Francis speaks the prolife message with simplicity while recognizing both the multiple dimensions and the moral complexity of the world’s social problems. He suggests that being prolife demands a sensitivity to the various ways in which human life is denied or diminished. In the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii gaudium Francis provides four principles meant to guide those working toward achieving a more just society that recognizes and respects the life and dignity of each person. Here I briefly review those principles.

TI  - The Influence of Religiosity and Contraception on the Likelihood of Abortion among Reproductive Age Women

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the influence of the three most frequently used methods of contraception (i.e., the hormonal pill, the male condom, and sterilization – male and female) on the likelihood of having an abortion among United States (US) reproductive age women (15-44). A second purpose is to determine the influence of Church attendance and importance of religion on the likelihood of having an abortion among US reproductive age women. Findings show the ever use of contraceptive methods increased the likelihood of abortion from 56% to more than 11 times and that frequent church attendance and those women who hold religion to be very important in their lives decreased the likelihood of abortion compared to women who were not religious and not on the three methods of contraception. Recommendations included supporting traditional religiosity that supports chastity, marriage, and family planning methods that integrate human sexuality.

TI  - A Twenty-Year History (1958-1978) of Contraception and Abortion as Experienced by the Catholic Medical Association
AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - This paper is an historical analysis of the issues of contraception and abortion as presented through the focus and lens of articles in The Linacre Quarterly, the official journal of the Catholic Medical Association (CMA). The twenty-year history includes the ten years before and after the pivotal papal encyclical Humanae vitae (HV). The articles show the clear link between the issues of contraception and abortion and how these issues led to the decline of the Federation of the Catholic Physician Guilds (the precursor of the CMA in the United States). It was a decline that, I propose, lessened opposition to liberalized abortion laws. There is, however, a new and revised CMA that has been built on a faithful and prolife membership of physicians and other health professionals.

TI  - Be Compassionate as your Father is Compassionate: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Compassion
AU  - Duran, Marek
AB  - In her book Memoir of Mary Ann, Flannery O'Connor captured well the current cultural milieu when she wrote: “In the absence of faith, we govern by tenderness, and tenderness leads to the gas chamber.” In our Western societies, most of the human atrocities are done in the name of compassion. We should, however, ask ourselves: “are we good simply because we feel good?” (AL 145). The aim of this essay is to salvage compassion as a basis for a Christian ethos. As Johan Baptist Metz puts it, in a world that looks for consolation “compassion unto God” is a double provocation. It is the clearest sign of God’s existence as existence “for us” as well as a sign of a mature faith. I will argue, based on the teaching of Abraham Joshua Heschel who defines a prophet as the “incarnation of God’s passion” that compassion is a modality of life within the realm of the covenant. Every Christian baptized into Christ stands on the side of the weak ones to witness the value of human life as well as to the power of God’s love.

TI  - The Importance of Philosophical Arguments for the Reality of the Spiritual Soul in Prolife Work
AU  - Colosi, Peter J
AB  - In Embryo: A Defense of Life, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen have provided a defense of the life of early embryos against those who claim that such beings are not human beings. They masterfully summarize the findings of the most recent embryological research, referring to the studies and textbooks utilized by the highest level universities. These sciences have made it no longer possible to claim that an embryo is not a new distinct living human being. George and Tollefsen offer a concise and easily comprehensible presentation of these established scientific facts. But their view of human personhood is difficult to distinguish from epiphenomenalism and leaves the impression that the immaterial dimension of human persons has as its exclusive source the material body. They assert that the concept of “soul” will not make an appearance in their book, because that would be unneccessary and unhelpful. For this reason they tend to identify the “soul” with consciousness, reflection, choice, and the capacities that make those abilities possible. But these things need a foundational level of being in which to inhere. For George and Tollefsen this foundation is the body, which they refer to as the animal organism: this is the stance of epiphenomenalism. After giving a thorough expression of their position, I will offer a different explanation for explaining the unity of body and soul in persons, while avoiding the tendency towards epiphenomenalism. I call this view Realist Phenomenology/Christian Personalism1 and will contrast it with the New Natural Law approach represented in Embryo: A Defense of Life.

The second necessary condition is for all to recognize that human fulfillment comes about through a caring, person-centered love that is respectful of human life.

AB  - Although it may seem as though gay and lesbian fictional works would have nothing to do with the life issues, this research examines several instances where the right-to-life issues of abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia are mentioned in gay and lesbian fiction. Moreover, there is enough evidence to suggest that the literature comports more with a life-affirming philosophy, if not an overtly pro-life one. That is, the literature employs characters with same-sex attraction who do not necessarily support the killing of the unborn, the handicapped newborn, or the medically vulnerable or aged. Finally, this study demonstrates how using the five questions of right-to-life literary theory can provide an opportunity for persons with same-sex attraction to renounce their allegiance with the destructive elements of the contemporary gay and lesbian movement and, instead, align themselves with the pro-life movement, which is more compatible with their efforts to seek authentic love.

TI  - If the Fetus is a Part of the Mother, then Three Popular Abortion Defenses Fail on Purely Conceptual Grounds
AU  - Hershenov, David B
AB  - Some abortion defenders claim that a fetus is a part of a pregnant woman’s body. Abortion opponents often respond that a fetus is not a maternal part by stressing any or all of the following: differences in fetal and maternal DNA; the fetus does not function like a maternal body part contributing to the mother’s survival; the fetus’s developmental telos is towards independence from the mother; the fetus’s relation to the mother is that of a tenant to a niche, not a part to a whole; a fetus is a substance (a human being) and one substance cannot be a part of another substance. Drawing upon Elselijn Kingma’s work, I respond that these arguments provide little reason to doubt the claim that a fetus is a maternal part. Nevertheless, somewhat ironically, the fetal parthood thesis dooms the following three popular defenses of abortion: fetuses can be terminated on the grounds that they violate their mothers’ bodily integrity; fetuses can be killed for trespassing on their mothers’ bodies; fetuses can be aborted because pregnant women have a right to self-defense. These three defenses fail on merely conceptual grounds, for bodily parts cannot trespass upon the whole, nor can they violate the integrity of that whole, nor are they legitimate targets of a right to selfdefense if they are not external to the self.

AB  - Roe v.

This article attempts to remedy that, by drafting a model opinion that could be used to overrule Roe. The predicate for this article’s proposed decision is a state’s twenty-week limit on abortion, which (as of 2018) has been enacted by twenty-one states. All of the six primary factors of stare decisis are applied to Roe. Although judges and scholars might disagree whether all six factors are relevant to an overruling decision, each factor illuminates specific defects in Roe. Much of the significant scholarly criticism of the past forty-five years is compiled and cited here. Much of the judicial criticism of Roe and its workability is likewise compiled and cited. The opinion overrules the first holding in Roe, that there is a federal constitutional right to “terminate pregnancy.” This “draft” invites alternative formulations.

The idea of unalienable rights that the Founders espoused implies a rich philosophical anthropology in which rights and duties cannot be justly separated from one’s self. Consequently many pro-choice arguments, such as those in favor of allowing voluntary euthanasia, are in contradiction with the Founders’ conception of rights. Their concept of unalienablility can be re-articulated to address the new circumstances that bioethics confronts in the twenty-first century and is an enduring important aspect of American public philosophy.

To this end, I offer some suggestions about resources that the pro-life movement has and various ways in which it might work on forming a more pro-life culture in the face of elite resistance.

T2  - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology
AB  - The concept of “brain death” is controversial but widely accepted in practice. Current practice generally attempts to make a determination of death by using neurological criteria alone as a way to show “irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem.” This determination is to be made “in accordance with accepted medical standards” according to the 1981 Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA). Many state statutes are modeled on the UDDA. The apnea test is the final test in many protocols for a person in unresponsive coma of known cause, presumably irreversible, and is considered by some the “sine qua non” for “brain death.” But even some physicians who are in favor of the concept of brain death and vital organ procurement have called it “not defensible.” In this paper we review the apnea test procedure in the context of basic respiratory physiology and ventilator use. We examine its rationale and summarize its flaws. In particular, we bring attention to the recent Nevada statute that mandates use of the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines (AANG) to declare “brain death,” including the use of the apnea test without consent.

Eliot's personal life provided strong motives for sympathy with the negligent killers, but she mustered the artistic integrity to face the consequences of killing by inaction. Psychological and social damage follows neglecting fragile lives. Aware of the burdens involved in respecting life, Eliot warns readers against failing at this most basic act of human community.

Gorsuch clearly advocates for the inviolability of human life and sees that life is intrinsically valuable, but he does not address abortion. While it is not possible to predict with certainty how Justice Gorsuch will vote, his belief in the inherent value of human life is encouraging. We all must do our part.

AB  - This essay sets out seven principles intended to persuade non-pro-life students and uncommitted students to a prolife position by using principles and categories accepted by secular culture. It has been tested in a limited fashion, using a curriculum designed for high school students. The curriculum persuaded 71% of the students who were formerly non-pro-life or uncommitted, to change their minds and become pro-life. The first step is to provide the students with a self-motivating rationale to move them from a dominant ego-comparative identity to a dominant contributive-empathetic identity – a conversion of the heart that enables them to be open to the six principles of civility and civilization embraced by secular culture – the principles of non-maleficence, universal personhood, just law, inalienable rights, the necessary hierarchy of rights, and the intrinsic limits to human freedom. The encouraging results from our initial surveys indicate the effectiveness of this approach in helping the culture to recognize the goodness and civility of the pro-life position.

AB  - This paper argues that we have reason to broaden our ideas about the arrival of subjectivity in fetal development. It is often assumed that fetal subjectivity arises at a certain point in time on account of the development of the brain and that before there is sufficient development of the brain there is no reason to posit subjectivity in the developing child. There are, however, reasons for situating fetal subjectivity differently, given that our regular recourse to the language of irreducible substance needs to assume a richer and more mysterious philosophy of nature. There is simply no metaphysical reason for limiting minds to brains, given the failure of the mechanical model to explain mental activity, especially when mental semantics are already employed to describe the behavior of embryonic and fetal striving.

AB  - This essay discusses my efforts to integrate daily Bible readings into an upper-division course entitled “Ethics in Science.” This approach involves having students keep a daily journal about what they discover by considering on various topics of biomedical ethics in relation to a broad range of philosophical perspectives and to the natural law and divine command philosophies.

AU  - Lu, M T
AB  - In this paper I evaluate Peter Singer’s claims that “speciesism” is morally akin to racism and sexism. I argue that once we properly understand what makes racism and sexism wrong we will see that “speciesism” is fundamentally disanalogous to those injustices. Unlike racism and sexism, the acknowledgment of the moral value of all human beings reflects a true judgment about human nature as the rational grounds for the moral dignity of persons.

AB  - This paper addresses two issues that would arise upon the overruling of Roe v. Wade: First, whether pregnant women who self-abort or consent to an abortion performed upon them by a third party would likely be subject to prosecution in those States where abortion was illegal. Second, what the legal status of abortion would be in the States. The paper concludes, in Part I, that, based upon our history and experience women would not be prosecuted for abortion, and in Part II, that the immediate consequences of an overruling decision upon the legality of abortion would be very limited.

AB  - What is the basis for full moral worth or being a subject of rights? Are all human beings, or only just some, subjects of basic rights? This paper argues that the basis for being a subject of rights is a substantial nature – as opposed to an accidental attribute or set of accidental attributes, and, specifically, a rational nature, that is, a nature oriented to conceptual thought and deliberate choice. It also answers the objection that some beings are human beings and yet lack a rational nature, such as brain-dead bodies and radically cognitively impaired human beings.

AB  - This study reviews literary works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that concern bioethics and such right-to-life issues as abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. After considering various definitions of “bioethics,” the paper identifies three general themes in the literary works and examines how each of these themes is depicted. Finally, the research highlights fictional works using ethical standards developed from religious sources that fill the moral void evident in most bioethics fiction.

TI  - Medical Ethics and the Externalization of Agency
AU  - Giebel, Heidi
AB  - In this paper I position recent controversies regarding conscience protection for healthcare workers as part of a more general trend in medicine – I call it the “externalization of agency.” Agency is externalized when the perspective of one agent (in this case, a healthcare worker) on her own actions is subverted to the perspective of another agent or group (e.g., a patient, employer, or professional or legal body). After illustrating this phenomenon with a recent case in which a midwife was fired and effectively blacklisted for refusing to perform abortions, I examine other cases to which it applies, including euthanasia. I note the similarities between the externalization of agency and the seemingly opposite phenomenon of excessive paternalism. In each case one agent’s perspective is entirely coopted by another. The remedy to both problems is collaboration and respect for the agency of all parties.

TI  - Influence of Current Contraceptive Use on the Abortion and Sexually Transmitted Disease Rates among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States
AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AU  - Bouchard, Thomas
AU  - Meyers, Maria
AB  - Hormonal and other types of contraceptive methods are often prescribed to adolescents and young adults for the treatment of health problems and to avoid unwanted pregnancies. We hypothesized that there is a greater likelihood of pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and sexual behaviors that enhance such problems (e.g., earlier sexual debut and multiple sex partners) for single adolescents and young adults currently using contraception than for adolescents and young adults not using contraception. To test this hypothesis, we used data from 1,365 adolescents and young adults in the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth to describe the influence of current use of contraception on sexual debut, multiple sex partners, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and abortion. We found that current use of contraception by adolescents and young adults in the U.S. results in a greater likelihood of pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases compared with the rates for those adolescents and young adults who never used oral contraceptives. Furthermore, those adolescents who currently use oral contraceptives had significantly more male sexual partners than those who never used them and an earlier sexual debut by almost five years. We concluded that the use of oral contraceptives by adolescents and young adults facilitates higher risk sexual behaviors. Further research is recommended to confirm these associations.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of the abortion jurisprudence of abortion in both the United States and Poland. It analyzes the constitutions, statutes, and judicial precedents that have affected abortion access in both of those countries. The paper also attempts to show how Catholic Social Teaching, particularly as read through the lens of St. John Paul II in Evangelium Vitae, offers a way to accommodate the constitutional values that are articulated in the founding documents of these nations. John Paul II does this by encouraging renewed respect for the human rights of all the members of the human family, support for democratic frameworks that moderate majoritarian impulses, and (when other measures fail) a respect for conscience rights. It is only in protecting both the life and dignity of the woman and her child that nations like these can fulfill the aspirations of their founding documents.

TI  - “Brain Death” Is a Mendacity
AU  - Byrne, Paul A
AB  - Patients who are declared “brain dead” still have a beating heart with circulation and respiration. There is an interdependence of cells, tissues, and organs that maintain the soul/body unity. Death is separation of this unity. It leaves on earth the remains called a cadaver, a corpse. This essay argues that the term “brain death” is a mendacity that was invented to get organs for transplantation. No one ought to be declared dead unless there is no respiration, no heart beat, and no circulation. The cessation of these functions must be irremediable and determined in accord with generally accepted standards.

AB  - This paper succinctly refutes the main arguments currently brought forth in defense of the concept of brain death. I begin with a reminder that a sound definition of life was articulated by Aristotle and accepted by St. Thomas Aquinas. Neglecting that definition and its underlying philosophy leads to confusion. Such confusion is apparent in the way scientists and philosophers who defend brain death have misinterpreted the significance of persistent cellular life in cadavers and in explanted organs. I conclude by also showing that, despite a permanent loss of capacity for rational thought, brain-dead bodies cannot be considered subhuman.

It also addresses the shift in the perspective of students (and of the American population), not just on the morality of this practice but also on our understanding of what it means to be human. The challenge is experienced by the general population more as a spiritual issue more than a moral one. It reveals itself to be so in light of what I will call “five tricks of the heart” (a phrase based on Jeremiah 17:9). These are temptations to the idols of absolute autonomy, pleasure, an achieved sense of dignity, independence, and control. The presentation closes with a call for the Church to teach people how to die well, a modern ars moriendi.

AB  - The Right-to-Life movement links moral and legal principles. “Rights” define boundaries of inclusion and also boundaries of exclusion. This paper argues that we need to foster an inclusive society. The abolition of slavery in America in the nineteenth century may point the way to how the abolition of abortion may be achieved in the twenty-first century. It took patient perseverance until a crisis compelled the nation finally to resolve the slavery issue. Social acceptance and legal approval of killing weaken the moral foundation of our society and of our legal system. American women generally give three major reasons for having abortions. Considering these reasons may point to how to eliminate elective abortion.

If you were the original organism, then you do not survive as the residuum. In this paper I give an explanation of what is meant by “irreplaceable part”; explain why an human being cannot survive the loss of such a part; and argue that the brain is such a part.

AB  - Abortion – in fact, bioethics more broadly – is rarely discussed within an existential-phenomenological framework, even though many themes that the abortion issue encompasses (e.g., selfhood) are existential in nature. The effort to do bioethics from the existential point of view will produce its own unique challenges. This essay attempts to apply the insights of existential-phenomenology to the abortion debate. It argues that abortion is an act of existential despair by using Gabriel Marcel’s comments on the phenomenological notion of “having” and Kierkegaard’s understanding of despair as the self’s refusal to be itself. BY way of example it considers two cases of “bodily despair”: (1) the treatment of the body as a machine and the tendency to consider the child as an unwanted object, and (2) the body’s misrelation of itself to itself in defiantly choosing to terminate the pregnancy.

AB  - Obergefell v. Hodges is an enormously important decision that will have profound effects on marriage and religious liberty in the United States. The principal basis for the Court’s holding that laws defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman are unconstitutional was the doctrine of substantive due process rather than on equality. The Court’s reliance on substantive due process revived a doctrine that had fallen into disfavor and opens the prospect that the doctrine might be used to overrule Washington v. Glucksberg. In this paper I address the likelihood of the Court using Obergefell to invalidate laws banning assisted suicide.

I then apply that account to the case of brain death and conclude that a brai-dead body lacks the unity proper to a human organism and has therefore undergone a substantial change. I also show how my view can explain hard cases better than one in which biological integration (as understood by Alan Shewmon and the President’s Council) is taken to imply ontological wholeness or unity.

TI  - Animals, Advance Directives, and Prudence: Should We Let the Cheerfully Demented Die?
AU  - Limbaugh, David
AB  - A high level of confidence in the identity of individuals is required to let them die as ordered by an advance directive. Thus, if we are animalists, then we should lack the confidence required to apply lethal advance directives to the cheerfully demented, or so I argue. In short, there is consensus among animalists that the best way to avoid serious objections to their account is to adopt an ontology that denies the existence of brains, hands, tables, chairs, iced-tea, and lemonade. The adoption of such an ontology reduces the justificatory force of commonsense, which is key in arguing that we are animals and that we persist as long as we are biologically alive. With this loss of justification comes the loss of a high level of confidence that Quinn-pre-dementia’s lethal advanced directive applies to Quinn-post-dementia, via identity. If we do not have a high level of confidence that Quinn-pre-dementia’s advanced directive applies to Quinn-postdementia, then it is not enough (on its own) to let Quinn-post-dementia die.

TI  - A Bridge That Does Not Exist: Reductio ad Absurdum and the Socratic Method in Teaching on the Issues of Abortion and Euthanasia

AB  - In the current social and political climate, the conventional notion is that compromise is eminently desirable, the hallmark of reasonableness, and the non-negotiable foundation of democracy. Hence, the only pro-life stance that is considered acceptable is one that includes exceptions. Such a stance would create a “bridge,” a comfortable third option between positions that are portrayed as radical, extreme, and unacceptable. This paper demonstrates the benefits of instructing students on the use of reductio ad absurdum and the Socratic Method when considering the topics of abortion and euthanasia. I use these techniques to expose the faulty assumption behind the “bridge” so that students can develop their powers of critical thinking, can take responsibility, and are enabled to make their own choice between the only two logically viable options.

AB  - This paper argues that, in order to build a culture of life, we must encourage not only joy at life but also sorrow at its loss. Joy is a passion that results from knowing and receiving what is good. The recognition that life is good must give rise to joy in the person who recognizes that good, both in himself and others. Sorrow, on the other hand, is the passion that results from knowing what is good, and recognizing an absence or loss of that good. As a result, the appropriate response to death, to the loss of the good that is life, is sorrow. Sorrow at a person’s death, especially if that death is preceded by suffering, indicates that life continues to be valuable in great suffering, because it recognizes that death is a loss of a good that was present even during his suffering.

What is more, their conceptions of dignity cannot even provide reasons why we should cure the extremely demented who are reduced to childlike or comatose states if we could do so. I then argue instead for an account of dignity in which our value depends upon the kind of entity that we are and upon a sense of what ends we ought to realize. Our moral status will be determined by the kind of healthy life that we are designed to live. It is not dependent upon any manifestation (present or earlier) of autonomy or rationality.

AB  - Some defend assisted suicide on the basis of autonomy. It is tempting to respond that such a position is self-defeating: after death there is no person left to enjoy the value of autonomy. This response is especially attractive because it seems to require only logic. Using the thought of the philosopher Michael B. Gill, I argue that plausible accounts of the value of autonomy are not, in fact, selfdefeating. Rather, the argument against assisted suicide must make a positive case that human life is a gift of a particular dignity that forbids it to be intentionally destroyed. Furthermore, an analysis of this debate over the meaning of autonomy and human dignity provides insight into a question sometimes raised by moral philosophers. Is moral reasoning more like appreciating beauty or doing mathematics? I argue that a good moral argument requires both movements.

Principally by examining the suicides in Othello, in Antony and Cleopatra, and in King Lear, this study argues that the suicides in Shakespeare’s plays are not meant to seduce the audience into sympathy for suicide. Instead, they are meant to draw the attention of the audience to certain spiritual failures in the characters, especially spiritual sloth, which can take the forms of a failure to care about the proper good of the soul and of a dissipation of attention that distracts from virtue, such as one finds in cases of restless activity and the pursuit of fame.

One is to look backward in the developmental process. It is easy to grasp that our fellow human beings all used to be zygotes. A second method is now becoming available.

AU  - Lemmons, R Mary Hayden
AB  - Assisted suicide laws instigate a bioethics not only contrary to the best practices of medicine but also to the philosophy of rights found in the Declaration of Independence. Yet the legalization of assisted suicide continues primarily due to the utilitarian argument that since life cannot be meaningful when autonomy and health are compromised, assisted suicide laws are compassionate. I argue to the contrary that these laws mask a deeper cruelty that interferes with the ability of the suffering to receive the support that they need. Especially crucial is the philosophical support that alleviates spiritual suffering by assigning it meaning in a variety of ways that is both compassionate and compatible with religious beliefs. Helping the suffering assign meaning to suffering is what true compassion requires of both medical professionals and family members.

TI  - Abortion Distortion: Correcting Literary Criticism’s Misreading of Early Twentieth-Century Abortion Fiction
AU  - Koloze, Jeff
AB  - This article discusses literary works on abortion from the first half of the twentieth century, identified by Meg Gillette in recent (2012) research. Gillette’s analysis considers the works (mostly novels) using standard feminist literary theory, which views abortion primarily from the mother’s perspective, ignoring the father and the unborn child. This article, however, expands the feminist interpretation by including a lifeaffirming perspective. Thus, a more inclusive reading of the fictional works is obtained which necessarily considers the perspective of the mother, the role of the father, and the status of the unborn child. The article suggests areas for future research of the works for a further right-tolife literary appreciation.

TI  - Why the Right to Elective Abortion Fails Casey’s Own Interest-Balancing Methodology and Why It Matters
AU  - Gilles, Stephen G
AB  - Under Casey, the right to elective abortion rests on an interestbalancing judgment that the woman’s specially protected interest in terminating her pregnancy outweighs the State’s interest in protecting the life of her pre-viable fetus. Yet, although Casey’s own methodology calls for doing so, the Court has never explained or defended that judgment on the merits. This article argues that this foundational interest-balancing judgment is unsound when evaluated on Casey’s own terms and using Casey’s own methodology and should therefore be relied on only when strictly required by Casey’s re-affirmation of Roe’s “essential holding.”

TI  - Restricting Abortions at Eight Weeks Is Consistent with the Legal Principles of Roe v. Wade
AU  - Degnan, Michael J
AB  - The principle at work in the Supreme Court’s 1997 cases on doctor-assisted suicide can be applied to its abortion cases, provided that the justices agree that eight-week old fetuses are human beings. The application of this principle does not demand renunciation of the claim that women have a right to abortion. It does require a specification about what the right to abortion entails, namely, that a woman has the right to seek to have her unborn offspring separated from her prior to natural term. She has the right to refuse to nourish and sustain the new life within her. The right to seek separation is not, however, the right to seek dismemberment or death of this a human being, for there is a compelling State interest in prohibiting acts that are necessarily the intentional dismemberment or killing of human life.

AU  - Deavel, David P
AB  - The Urtext of modern vampire fiction and film, Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, departs notably from modern neutral or heroic views of the vampire. Stoker’s vision has a distinctly Christian vision both of evil and of the conditions to fight evil that displays and illuminates what many have described as a culture of death and a culture of life. The vampiric culture of death displays the combination of sexual anarchy, aggression, and unconcern for life that so characterize our times. The international band of vampire hunters led by the Protestant Mina Harker and the Catholic Van Helsing display the combination of natural and supernatural knowledge and gifts that are needed to fight monstrous evils successfully. Law, science, scholarship, technology, and capital are combined with Christian knowledge, faith, and piety to give modern day advocates for life a working model of the tools and attitudes needed for a culture of life.

TI  - Historical Re-enactments: A Key Pro-life Argument
AU  - Bellinger, Charles
AB  - Pro-life advocates sometimes say that there is an analogy between slavery, the Shoah, and abortion. I argue that the word “reenactment” is preferable to “analogy” in such comparisons. I draw on a theoretical understanding of the roots of violent behavior that I have developed over the past two decades. This understanding employs key concepts from the philosophical anthropologies of Søren Kierkegaard, Eric Voegelin, and René Girard in making the case that the deep-level, unconscious motives that impel human beings toward violent acts can be comprehended. These deep motives remain the same while the expressions of violence vary with time and place as conscious ideologies shift and change. Forms of violence that occur later in history are thus reenactments of earlier forms. Slavery was a vertical axis pathology; there are many variations on horizontal plane pathologies. Abortion is a pathology within the dimension of individual selfhood.

TI  - Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the United States: A Current Legal Perspective
AU  - Myers, Richard S
AB  - This paper offers a brief review of the legal status of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in the United States. In the mid-1990s, it appeared that the Supreme Court might recognize a fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide. But in 1997, the Court rejected constitutional challenges to laws banning assisted suicide. Since then, the battle over assisted suicide has largely shifted to a state-by-state debate that has largely been conducted outside the federal courts. A few states have legalized physician-assisted suicide and public opinion has moved in favor of assisted suicide in the last few years but the overall situation has been relatively stable. There are, however, some worrisome trends. International developments and the increasing acceptance of a quality-of-life ethic create cause for concern. Fortunately, the Court’s 1997 decisions have created an opportunity for those who support the sanctity of life ethic to advance their views and to resist the “right to die” movement.

TI  - Select Twentieth and Twenty-First-Century Assisted Suicide Fiction: Themes and Absences in the Works
AU  - Koloze, Jeff
AB  - This paper identifies common themes in the fictional literature on assisted suicide, classifying them as either major or minor. Three major themes include the absence of or, when they are present, distortion of religious values regarding assisted suicide and end-of-life decisions; the defeatist or utilitarian attitudes toward pain and suffering; and the use of the standard dehumanizing language found in euthanasia debates. At least six minor themes can be culled from the works under review: first, the diminution or eradication of the idea that life is sacred; second, the aesthetics of death; third, the definition of suicide; fourth, antiCatholicism; fifth, a decidedly liberal bent; and sixth, the use of rhetorical erotema. Fortunately, four recent works illustrate a life-affirming response to most assisted suicide fiction: Harry Kraus’s Lethal Mercy (1997), Nicholas Sparks’s The Choice (2007), Jane St. Clair’s Walk Me to Midnight (2007), and Fiorella De Maria’s Do No Harm (2013).

AB  - In recent decades the effort to protect and defend the right to life of unborn children has increasingly involved regional intergovernmental organizations, as member states have created or strengthened regional implementation institutions. As a result, the decisions of these institutions enjoy a very high degree of compliance in some regions and thus have real-world consequences. This article assesses the most important implementation institutions, their major decisions affecting unborn life, how their members are chosen, and how pro-life governments and nongovernmental organizations can play a more effective role in trying to ensure that their work upholds the right to life of the unborn child. The regional bodies discussed here are not part of or subordinate to the United Nations, which has a quite different human rights system.

T2  - The Linacre Quarterly
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of contraception, abortion, and natural family planning (NFP) on divorce rates of U.S. women of reproductive age. The variables of importance of religion and frequency of church attendance were also included in the analysis. The study involved 5,530 women of reproductive age in the National Survey of Family Growth (2006-2010) who indicated that they were ever married. Among the women who ever used NFP, only 9.6% were currently divorced compared with the 14.4% who were currently divorced among the women who never used NFP (x2 = 5.34, p < 0.21). An “Odds Ratio” analysis indicated that ever having an abortion, sterilization and/or methods of contraception increased the likelihood of divorce up to 2 times. Frequency of church attendance decreased the risk of divorce. Although there is less divorce among NFP users, the reason might be the result of their religiosity.

AB  - A society, living without reference to God, without a sense of life’s meaning and great purpose, suffers from lack of acceptance, reconciliation, and love. Christian faith has a unique capacity to restore a civilization of love in the image of God who is Love. Such love affirms the other, first by being moved in delight by his/her good, and then by manifesting this delight. To love in this way, we must “be swept up by God.” It is in worshiping Christ hidden in the Eucharist that we attune the eyes of our hearts to see in the unborn, the elderly, and the ill, the Image and Likeness of God. Seeing them with the love of God, we allow others to experience themselves as the sons and daughters of a God who loves gratuitously, accepting us as we are and transforming us into the people He knows we can be.

TI  - Of Wholes and Parts: A Thomistic Refutation of “Brain Death”

AB  - I propose a refutation of the two major arguments that support the concept of “brain death” as an ontological equivalent to death of the human organism. I begin with a critique of the notion that a body part, such as the brain, could act as “integrator” of a whole body. I then proceed with a rebuttal of the argument that destruction of a body part essential for rational operations—such as the brain—necessarily entails that the remaining whole is indisposed to accrue a rational soul. Next, I point to the equivocal use of the terms “alive” or “living” as being at the root of conceptual errors about brain death. I appeal to the Thomistic definition of life and to the hylomorphic concept of “virtual presence” to clarify this confusion. Finally, I show how the Thomistic definition of life supports the traditional criterion for the determination of death.

(5) The method that Savulsecu proposes for bringing about genetic moral enhancement – embryo or fetus selection, i.e., killing those embryos and fetuses not considered up to snuff – is itself ethically problematic.

Cowardly silence among the citizens of doomed Thebes seals their collusion in evil.

Lamenting an environmentally destructive dualism between man and nature, deep ecology seeks to rediscover the kinship between all living things. The kinship is in fact established by DNA on a microscopic level and by procreation on a behavioral level. A careful examination of reproduction, as the feature distinguishing living from non-living things, shows that it imparts a moral structure to all life, a structure that is therefore biocentric rather than merely anthropocentric. The honest deep ecologist will not be able to avoid this conclusion for long.

AB  - Latin America, a “continent-plus,” is strongly pro-life. Efforts, however, are being made by anti-life forces to “liberalize” laws there to permit abortion. A team of Latin American lawyers has produced a major study of Latin America’s laws in order to demonstrate the pro-life commitment that exists there and to document the threats to life that exist, while suggesting revisions to national laws to strengthen pro-life protection. The study notes the fact that, despite dire predictions to the contrary, maternal mortality does not increase when abortion is prohibited, as studies within Latin America have shown. This essay reviews the results of the study by Latin American legal professionals and discusses why any durable conception of human rights must be based upon the inviolable right to life of all human beings.

The author establishes four criteria by which hundreds of pro-life works have been evaluated for inclusion: they must have been published since the 1960s, they must have been written or translated into English, the authors must be either lifeaffirming themselves or approach standard pro-life views on the essential three life issues, and the works must have obtained a level of commercial success such that their impact either on the pro-life community or on the larger culture is profound. The paper then discusses twenty-four works, highlighting their major contributions to the pro-life movement. The paper ends with future research and recommendations.

But what if the national practice of wholesale abortion inflicts serious damage on our community, culture, and national soul? This article explores the multi-faceted impacts of the abortion epidemic. It asserts that abortion is, in fact, a “cosmic” concern, affecting all of us in the body politic in a variety of ways. Moreover, biblical history and revelation indicate that it can lead to divine judgment and ruin. If so, this “single issue”must be understood not as one of several policy options but as a meta-factor in determining the future of our civilization.

Without in any way downplaying the evil of these means, this paper suggests that the rape/incest exception for abortion in fact proves the rule of life. In order to substantiate this claim, the article offers a brief introduction to the anthropology of René Girard so as to situate the abortion crisis in its properly “world-sacrificial” context. Then, in presenting some ways in which a political rhetoric can engage the dialogue of abortion and win the case for pro-life by speaking to a common ground, the case is made for a call to re-situate the discussion in terms of the Western defense of scapegoats.

Third, I use this approach to provide a virtues-based grounding for a bioethics like Pellegrino’s. Fourth, I acknowledge and reply to Pellegrino’s own reservations about such grounding. My fifth and sixth sections relate and compare this approach both to mainstream principlism and to recent “progressive bioethics” by indicating that, properly conceived, the ethical practice of medicine faces constraints that militate against the progressive agenda. Lastly, I use this virtue-based grounding in summarizing, analyzing, and rebutting some objections that have been raised against Pellegrino’s views.

AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate and discuss three case scenarios of women (and their spouses) who are experiencing difficult life situations in which they might choose to have an abortion if they would have an unintended pregnancy. For these situations the current medical profession often recommends sterilization, for either the woman or her spouse, so as to prevent an unintended pregnancy. The three cases involve: (1) a woman with breast cancer and on a medication that would result in a deformed child, (2) a woman with five children under the age of five who is currently breastfeeding an infant, and (3) a peri-menopausal woman who has a health problem and who has a significant risk for having a child with Down’s syndrome. The use of modern natural family planning (NFP) methods and special protocols developed by researchers at Marquette University to manage these special problems will be presented. An argument will also be made that the use of NFP is more healthy and beneficial for the woman, her potential child, her spouse, and family. Conversely, use of hormonal contraception is either medically contra-indicated in these situations or unnecessary.

AB  - The abortion divide is commonly viewed as an ideo-logical conflict, but there are other aspects to be considerd. Abortion-related businesses, silently springing up and maturing over the past forty years, influence the abortion debate from an economic perspective. Financial considerations wield considerable power in maintaining the status quo. This paper focuses on commercial sectors whose origin and growth are a result of legalized abortion. The business aspects of the abortion industry are not widely known. They include supplying electively-aborted fetuses to industries that exploit them for economic gain. An unintended consequence of the essentially unencumbered right to abortion has been the creation of a vast and lucrative market in fetal tissue, fetal organs, and fetal parts. Supply is met by abortion facilities. Demand comes from government, educational, and commercial institutions involved in research and development in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and the cosmetics industry.

I then turn to the question whether we have positive obligations toward human embryos to promote their life and health as fundamental goods. In particular, I defend the moral liceity of the “adoptive rescue” of cryopreserved embryos as a supererogatory act on the part of pro-life individuals or couples. I also respond to the charge of inconsistency for those who affirm embryonic personhood and yet do not act to counter the phenomenon of “natural embryo loss.”

In his work for the Vichy regime he directed programs aimed at the elimination of those considered unfit for existence. Carrel’s eugenic theories and practices reflect the strong eugenic mentality of scientific and political elites on the eve of the Second World War.

TI  - Fetus as Child: A Suggestion for Pro-Life Vocabulary
AU  - Chan, Karen
AB  - This paper argues that the abortion debate has reached a stalemate. Because the terms “person” and “rights” are defined so differently and are so contentious, discussions are often saddled with equivocations and resolution seems impossible. To move the issue forward, this paper suggests that the pro-life movement should engage the battle on a different front, namely, by focusing on seeing a fetus as a “child” who is, by his or her very biology, related to a mother. By shifting the debate away from individuals and toward relationships, this paper sketches how we may be able to use the biological relationship to establish concretely duties and obligations on the part of mothers toward their unborn children.

AU  - Tully, Patrick
AB  - Some believe that abortion is wrong because it harms the fetus by depriving it of its future. Dean Stretton rejects his argument. He claims that the harm of death is not a sufficient source of the right to life and that, even if it were, a fetus cannot be seriously harmed by being deprived of its future. In this article I critically assess Stretton’s arguments for each of these claims and find these arguments problematic. In doing so, I believe that I successfully defend against Stretton’s attack the initial plausibility of the deprivation argument.

AB  - Most arguments for the pro-life position are arguments from the transcendental of Truth–it is true that we must uphold the inherent dignity of human life–and the transcendental of the Good–it is good always and everywhere to will the good of human life by all involved. The question is then, what about the third transcendental of Beauty. Is there an argument for Life from the transcendental of Beauty? My thesis is that by using the theological aesthetics of the Church Father Irenaeus of Lyons (“the glory [beauty] of God is the living man”) and the theological aesthetics of the twentieth-century theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (“Beauty is the word that shall be our first”), one can make the powerful argument for Life from the transcendental of Beauty. In short, we should be for Life because we should be for Beauty.

AU  - Sutton, Matthew Lewis
AB  - Many methods exist for analyzing the rise of abortions and its connection with the absence of fathers. The dramatic changes in law, politics, ethics, and society provide material for various accounts of the decline in the culture of fatherhood, but the dramatic changes in Christian theologies of the Trinity also provide additional reasons for the decline. In this article I argue that to retrieve a culture of fatherhood we must retrieve a faith in God the Father. Through the use of select books of the New Testament, particularly Paul’s letters, I establish the causal relationship between a retrieval of theologies of the God the Father and the retrieval of a culture of fatherhood. Only by having a right understanding of the fatherhood presented to us by the God the Father above can we have a right understanding of fatherhood here below.

TI  - Originalism, The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution:
AU  - Strang, Lee J.
AB  - The role of the Declaration of Independence in constitutional interpretation is deeply contested among scholars. I argue that it does not play a unique role in constitutional interpretation but is one of many sources of the Constitution’s original meaning. First, I lay out the background debate over the use of the Declaration in constitutional interpretation and review the ways in which appeals to the Declaration have periodically arisen during times of national moral crisis, such as those over slavery and civil rights. I also detail how scholars have relied on the Declaration to support dramatically inconsistent claims with regard to political morality and constitutional norms. Assuming an originalist perspective on constitutional interpretation, I then argue that the historical evidence from the framing and ratification of the Constitution shows that the Declaration is simply one source of the original meaning of the Constitution. In addition, I contend that the Declaration is not the interpretative key to the Constitution because these documents are inconsistent and because the Declaration cannot provide sufficient interpretative guidance. Lastly, I advance arguments to establish that the Declaration is not independently legally binding. In doing so, I rebut many of the common claims made by scholars (“Declarationists”) who assert that the Declaration is more than simply one source of original meaning.

AB  - If a claim that appears utterly convincing to the speaker is treated as absurd by others, the speaker is likely to think those others willfully perverse. But perhaps those others simply fail to grasp some background truth that the speaker has assumed to be obvious. Rectification of their mistake can then provide a basis for unexpected agreement and for isolating those respondents who are in fact deeply hostile to the speaker’s claim. This Article suggests that many of our fellow citizens find the pro-life argument against lethal embryo research to be absurd simply because they mistakenly treat gestation as a process of construction rather than as a process of development. Only an isolated segment of those who favor such research may have abandoned our traditional shared belief in human equality and dignity. The contrast between construction and development is also used to illuminate our disagreements over abortion and euthanasia.

AU  - Snead, O Carter
AB  - The bulk of the discussion on the Schiavo case has been based on false factual premises. A careful review of the record reveals that the matter should not be regarded as a victory for spouses over parents or the individual over the government, in making decisions about life sustaining measures. It does not represent a victory for the right of autonomy and self-determination in this context. In fact, the opposite is true. The Florida courts abandoned the single most important mechanism the law provided for ensuring that Ms. Schiavo’s wishes would be reliably discerned and implemented–the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. As a result, it is not possible to have any confidence that Ms. Schiavo’s actual intentions were honored. Not only did the Florida courts persistently refuse to rigorously pursue the question of Ms. Schiavo’s actual wishes, they employed the bulk of their resources to conduct inquiry into questions relating to Ms. Schiavo’s present and future quality of life. This approach is inconsistent with the ideals of autonomy and self-governance at the end of life. Far from being a victory for freedom, the Schiavo matter represents an abject failure of the law to provide the framework within which autonomy might truly be exercised.

AB  - The subject of this paper is a novel by one of France’s most esteemed novelists, Emile Zola. It was written and published in the last two years of the nineteenth century and never re-published. The novel bears the title Fécondité, in English Fertility. It is extraordinary because of who the author was, on the one hand, and his radical endorsement of a pro-life philosophy on the other, at a time when fellow novelists and social reformers accepted as inevitable or actively promoted small families, contraception, and population control. The paper will proceed by first giving some background on Emile Zola, especially his views on the Catholic Church and science. It will then take up his notion of “salvation through love” and its relation to the family and procreation. These set the stage for a discussion of his ideas on life, love, and the population question in the novel Fécondité or Fruitfulness.

AU  - Shiffman, Mark
AB  - If modern thought is characterized by Gnosticism (i.e., the refusal to acknowledge the world as at once created, good, and gift), we can already recognize this fundamental attitude in the thought of John Locke. According to Locke, human labor is responsible for all the value added to the nearly worthless materials provided by nature. Applied to the human person, this doctrine reduces the self to the will, places it in opposition to the world, and conceives of the body as property owned by the self. It also severs the moral and metaphysical bond of child and parent. The embryo becomes property not yet capable of exercising its will and claiming its self-ownership, and the generations are joined only by coincidence of interests. Pope Benedict XVI proposes, as the only adequate response to modern gnosticism, a recovery of the doctrine of creation, which grounds gratitude for the gift of life.

AU  - Schindler, David L
AB  - The argument turns on the claim that the human person is constitutively related to God and others and as such bears a profound interiority and passion that imbue his freedom with a dramatic form. It is the constitutive relation to God and others that grounds human dignity and its call for authentic rights, and only a freedom filled with interiority and passion stemming from a memory of God will have the capacity in the end properly to recognize the dignity and rights of all, including the weakest. Thus, taking as its point of departure Evangelium Vitae’s teaching that two salient aspects of the culture of death are a self-centered notion of freedom and the “eclipse of the sense of God and of man,” the paper proposes that liberal democracy, even on its best reading, is unable to secure universal human dignity and rights because it understands persons and freedom in an ontologically self-centered way.

This attitude of faith as a way of looking at reality without an ideological lens, or even looking at nature without naturalistic assumptions, has long been a part of the Latin American historical landscape and culture. The case of Tabaré Vazquez (President of Uruguay from 2005 to 2010), a self-confessed agnostic and a socialist of the leftist political movement Frente Amplio (Broad Front), who vetoed a law that would have legalized abortion in Uruguay, is a striking example of such a Communist-Guadalupano. This paper is an account of his story and the reasons why a socialist president defended the right to life with arguments that would make any secularist cringe.

This claim also entails that in order to be a faithful and accurate interpreter of Aquinas today, one must reject the biological notions put forward by Aquinas himself.

AB  - The groups of people broadly characterized as “pro-life” and “pro-choice” seem to operate under remarkably different conceptual frameworks regarding the development of the unborn child. This disagreement over hominization and the status of the conceptus is profoundly rooted or “embedded” (in the words of Teresa Iglesias) in “different conceptualizations of the reality of the embryo.” Richard Stith describes these different conceptual frameworks as primarily two in number, “development” and “construction.” This article argues that the “construction” view of embryonic growth makes the common error of confusing something’s “shape” with its “substance” or “form” (using Thomistic terminology), while the “development” view does not make this mistake. One may therefore conclude from both philosophical and scientific stances–from the Thomistic metaphysics of “form” and from advances in embryology–that Stith’s development” model clearly seems superior to the “construction” model.

There are increasing pressures on healthcare professionals to conform their conduct to a secular vision of healthcare, even in situations when such professionals have a conscientious objection to facilitating, participating in, or performing various procedures. This paper evaluates the legal bases for conscientious objection in healthcare. Under current law, there is inadequate protection for those healthcare professionals who have religious and moral objections to governmental mandates. There is a pressing need for comprehensive protection for rights of conscience. Perhaps paradoxically, an effort to protect religious conscience has some risks because of the current pressures to privatize religion. In the long run, rebuilding a pro-life culture is the only sure protection for pro-life healthcare professionals.

AB  - Stem cell research is an exciting new area of science and medicine, but it raises serious ethical questions. Unfortunately, ethical discussions about the use of stem cells for medical therapy often end in confusion due to the technical nature of this research. This paper cuts through the confusion by explaining the basics of stem cells, especially regarding the difference between research that focuses on embryonic stem cells and human cloning, as opposed to research that uses adult stem cells. Once the science involved with stem cell research is understood, the ethical issues involved become clear. Embryonic stem cell research, including the use of cloning to harvest such stem cells, is unethical because it destroys human embryos. However, research using adult stem cells raises no ethical concerns and promotes the true common good. The paper concludes with several success stories regarding the good news of adult stem cell research.

AB  - The primary evil of abortion is found in its violation of a person’s right to life and of God’s absolute sovereignty over the life and death of the human person. Another, entirely different kind of evil is found in its repercussions in the psyche of the parents, and especially of the mother of the aborted child. Both of these issues are frequently discussed in the abortion debate. In what follows, I will suggest another perspective on abortion, one not commonly addressed: a metaphysical and existential perspective, which examines how abortion constitutes a retroactive destruction of the union of the couple in the spousal exchange. The analysis will involve two parts: first, the mutual entailment of love and life and, second, a metaphysics of embodied existence. These considerations will bring to light the way in which abortion strikes at the heart of the exchange of persons accomplished in the spousal act.

TI  - Locke on Bodily Rights and the Immorality of Abortion: A Neglected Liberal Perspective
AU  - Manchester, Eric
AB  - Abortion rights proponents often defend their position by insisting that women have a “right over what happens to their own bodies.” Such a view generally presupposes that pre-natal offspring are but “extensions” of a woman’s body. Ironically, however, the seventeenth-century philosopher (and physician) John Locke, whose enormously influential defense of individual property (and other democratic) rights takes as its basis a fundamental right that one has over his or her own “person” (normally interpreted as “body”) explicitly declares abortion to be among the most obviously immoral actions. This article examines Locke’s view of pre-natal offspring, while demonstrating how his opposition to abortion is consistent with other aspects of his philosophy. I also examine how one author who takes Locke to defend only a limited pro-life position can develop Locke’s principles further in establishing a stronger case against abortion rights. I apply these insights to refute the arguments of three other scholars who appeal to Locke’s general political theory in defending abortion rights. Lastly, I consider the concerns of certain pro-life advocates that Locke’s principles, despite his own personal opposition to abortion, naturally tend toward alienated individualism and the commodification of human life in such a way as to lend support to an abortion rights culture.

TI  - Fichte’s Idealism and Natural Rights: A Key to Understanding Seemingly Inconsistent Arguments for Abortion and Euthanasia
AU  - Manchester, Eric
AB  - Abortion and euthanasia opponents are often puzzled by the seemingly inconsistent position held by defenders of these practices. Prematurely-born infants, for example, are regarded as having a right to life while more physically developed fetuses are not. By contrast, in respect to euthanasia, greater physical functionality generally diminishes the degree to which death is considered acceptable. Such inconsistencies are surprisingly cogent when considered in light of the rights theory advanced by the eighteenth-century idealist philosopher G. W. Fichte. Fichte’s views often coincide with contemporary liberal convictions, including the beliefs (1) that the fetus is a part of a woman’s body, (2) that morality cannot be legislated, (3) that religious institutions should refrain from political discourse that challenges “rational” secular values, and (4) that one has a right to do whatever he or she wishes, as long as it does not directly interfere with another’s body. This essay examines how Fichte’s idealism develops conceptions of nature, personhood, and rights that justify abortion and euthanasia. But despite the rigor of Fichte’s system, it can only avoid the charge of making certain ad hoc metaphysical commitments that are in tension with other contemporary liberal convictions by supplementing its idealistic account of personhood and rights with certain biological criteria that actually undermine the case for abortion and euthanasia.

AU  - MacPherson, Ryan C.
AB  - Advocates for political rights to abortion and physicianassisted suicide often support their positions with pro-choice rhetoric: a woman should be free to choose whether or not to carry a child to term; terminally ill patients should be free to choose whether to wait until the disease completes its course or to end their lives sooner. In each case, however, a coercive reality lies behind the pro-choice rhetoric. That is to say, advocates for the apparent right to choose seek legislation that ultimately coerces dissenters to become complicit against their will. The current political debates on these issues therefore bear close analogy to America’s antebellum debates over slavery: rhetoric that initially seemed to be an argument for states’ rights or popular sovereignty soon revealed itself to be an emergent national policy that required all non-slaveholders, including abolitionists, to take action in support of the slavery regime. Similarly, political activists who deploy pro-choice rhetoric in favor of abortion or physician-assisted suicide resort to coercion in order to obtain and exercise the power to make such choices. Arguably, it cannot be otherwise, for coercion is necessary to maintain widespread social acceptance of choices that so fundamentally violate natural law.

AB  - Do people rate the consistent life ethic as making them more likely to oppose death-causing practices? Do they similarly rate the idea that killing is traumatic? An online survey offered these as two of five arguments connecting abortion, capital punishment, and war when asking respondents to rate the impact of each argument on each issue. Consistency and trauma were rated as moving toward opposition on practices that the respondents favored, but primarily with respondents who opposed one practice but favored the other. Those who favored both were less impressed. An argument favoring abortion to deter crime by eliminating future criminals also moved people who favored abortion availability toward opposing abortion. Consistency and trauma are two arguments that can strengthen the case against each form of sociallyapproved killing, but most strongly in those who already oppose one form and can therefore be encouraged to apply those arguments to other forms.

The current non-recognition of unborn human beings as persons is the result of discrimination, and its consequences include a denial of equal protection and due process. A legal system that creates a class of depersonalized human beings who may be exploited as subjects for scientific experiments or simply terminated for the benefit of those human beings who are chosen to be born substitutes rule by law for the rule of law. The text of the Fourteenth Amendment and constitutional jurisprudence both support the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey on the basis that all human beings are persons who cannot be denied constitutional personhood by any society that values life, liberty, justice and equality.

TI  - NATURAL KINDS, PERSONS, AND ABORTION
AU  - Garcia, Laura
AB  - Some moral philosophers contend that while all human persons are worthy of moral regard, those human beings who are not persons are not worthy of moral regard (or the same kind and quality of moral regard that we give to others). Elective abortion ends a pregnancy by ending the life of a developing human being. On its face, this practice violates a widely-held moral precept, that one may never intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. Arguments favoring the moral acceptability of abortion commonly incorporate at least one of the following claims: (a) the human em bryo/fetus/etc. is not a human being; (b) some human beings are not human persons; or (c) it is morally acceptable to intentionally kill some innocent human persons. I argue that (a) is necessarily false. Claim (b) can be read in two ways, and I contend that it is necessarily false on one reading and highly implausible on the other. While I do not try to disprove (c), I argue that the burden of proof falls on its defenders.

TI  - Should Advanced Practice Nurses Perform Abortions? Debate in the Profession
AU  - Laabs, Carolyn A
AB  - There has been discussion in the literature that legal permission should be granted to advanced practice nurses to perform first trimester surgical and medical abortions. In this paper I argue that even if laws allow nurses to perform abortions, nurses should not do so. Abortion is contrary to the tradition and values of the nursing profession. To become abortion providers would violate the integrity of the nursing profession and cause harm to mother and child. Both are patients for whom nursing professes to advocate and protect. Rather than abandon patients to abortion, nursing should direct its efforts toward genuinely promoting the health and well-being of every patient, born and unborn.

TI  - Death Scenes in Literature from the Nineteenth Century to Current Fi
AU  - Koloze, Jeff
AB  - This paper considers five elements found in the nineteenthcentury depiction of death scenes. (1) Dying characters have the benefit of being in a comforting place before they die, and (2) they have contact with a caring human being. (3) Removal of pain of the individual dying is a significant concern; (4) material goods, in contrast, are insignificant to the dying. Finally, (5) spiritual solace can be found in the death scenes. After showing how these elements are depicted in significant passages in the novels of Dickens, the paper then documents how the elements can be discovered in early twentieth-century novels; by century’s end, however, the elements were almost completely absent. The paper examines contemporary twenty-first century novels whose death scenes include the five elements and suggests that future research is needed before a literary trend of novels rediscovering the nineteenth-century standard can be established.

TI  - PRUDENCE AND TELOS IN PRO-LIFE EVOLUTION
AU  - Kelly, James R.
AB  - It has been almost four decades since Roe v. Wade and abortion remains an inconclusively disruptive part of every Supreme Court nomination process and every presidential election. While decades old national surveys show only glacial change in public opinion, though in a prolife direction, the public debate has changed in morally significant ways. Abortion opponents now unanimously accept that stopping abortion requires comprehensive help for woman who are pregnant and tempted to abortion by life circumstances–often of poverty and male irresponsibility. Abortion proponents increasingly acknowledge that abortion most often is more an unhappy decision than the consciousness enlarging experience intrinsic to the practice of authentic human rights. To continue as a vital cultural presence, social movements require both prudence and telos. Since the 1992 Supreme Court Casey decision the pro-life movement has prudently pursued an “incremental way” characterized by persuasion, assistance, and truth. But to remain vital, prudence requires an explicit beckoning horizon, a telos. The animating moral core, the essence, the ultimate goal of the movement opposing abortion is to become ever more consistently pro-life in its commitment to nonviolence. The ultimate fates of the peace and pro-life movements are morally intertwined.

The argument criticized is that which begins with an ontological definition of “person” and then seeks to establish that the human embryo cannot be a person if it does not fulfill that definition. The suggested alternative is that we regard the person as a receiver and giver of gifts. It is illegitimate to base our moral assessments of personhood on a moment abstracted from the process of time. The embryo is a receiver and giver of gifts from the beginning of its life and its development is a continuous process of receiving and giving. Deliberately to disrupt that process is to destroy a person. The ultimate question is not so much what kind of being the embryo is but whether we can and ought love the embryo.

AU  - Hilliard, Marie T
AB  - As the largest provider of non-governmental, non-profit health care and one of the largest and most efficient providers of social services in the United States, the Catholic Church has become viewed as a secular institution engaged in the welfare of the larger society, and at its behest. This has escalated into legislative and judicial initiatives that attempt to force the Church, and its members, to violate their tenets in the delivery of services, and to silence the exercise of free speech aimed at protecting the unborn. This article examines the societal influences that are eroding religious liberty and free speech, especially in the ministries of Catholic agencies and individuals. Furthermore, this article cites the foreboding impacts of continued acquiescence to these trends and the need to exercise the rights to religious liberty and free speech envisioned by the drafters of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

TI  - The Orientation of Freedom toward Bodily Integrity: Defending the Oocyte from Extracorporeal Manipulation
AU  - Henkel, Kimberly
AB  - Modern science views the oocyte as manipulable matter at the service of human purposes. This reductive concept of nature reveals an improper notion of freedom. When freedom is conceived fundamentally as choice, nature is stripped of any inherent value and subordinated to the dictates of man. Thomas Aquinas reveals a fuller account of freedom that is responsive to the goodness already present in nature, thereby restoring a sense of interiority to nature. There is an intrinsic value to the oocyte in its natural end that is entirely distinct from any purposes we may intend. Drawing on John Paul II’s nuptial meaning of the body and the understanding of natural inclinations in Aquinas, I hope to develop the value of the oocyte within the context of the goodness of sexual union. Since the natural end of the oocyte is to form new life, attempts to divert it from this path not only frustrate the telos of the oocyte but ultimately violate the woman, the marital act, marriage, and love, thus serving as an affront to God and the “procedures” that he has set up for the continuation of humanity.

Voting is an act of cooperation in the acts of others, and so must be analyzed on those grounds. By means of a description of the Church’s natural law understanding of the relation between the person, morality, law, and the State, Sections I through VI establish a set of principles concerning the gravity of the goods or evils in which we might cooperate by our vote, so as to enable us to analyze the proportionality involved in the decision. Sections VII and VIII explain the circumstances under which it is legitimate to cooperate in another’s evil acts, which one often does when one votes. Sections IX through XII combine these principles and apply them to various voting situations.

Protecting innocent human life, moreover, is foundational for a system of law. But if a “reform” proposal excludes some human beings from protection, it is intrinsically unjust and attacks the law’s very foundation. A law that excludes the disabled from protection is such a proposal. If such a law is proposed, it is wrong to support it. Therefore, it is wrong to vote for such a law. A Thomist understanding of law, prudence, and mercy informs this line of argument. The recent debate between Colin Harte and John Finnis, which I explore, affords an introduction to the sources of my argument and its implications.

Indeed, Maritain stoutly denies (1) that the embryo has a rational soul and (2) that the early fetus is a human being. Maritain, of course, would oppose both abortion and embryonic stem cell research. Still, he badly undermines the best reasons for doing so. In this essay I identify and criticize Maritain’s “argument from complexity” and his “argument from virtual presence.” Together, these arguments lead him to claim that the embryo is not formally a human. In addition, I assess Maritain’s explicit efforts to link his inadequate embryology with what he presents as the core of a Thomist theory of evolution. Embryology, he insists, models evolution. To support his case, however, Maritain introduces a category of transformational change, the use of which proves incompatible with numerical identity over time. In the end, to our dismay, a series of unsound arguments finds Maritain putting at risk the unity of the human being.

In a strange twist of fate, Laughlin developed a disability later in life that would, theoretically, make him subject to the very sort of laws that he so enthusiastically endorsed. The paper concludes with a brief reflection on the implications of Laughlin’s career for current struggles with similar issues related to the value of human life.

She claimed that there was a natural “evolution” from infanticide to abortion to contraception, with all three stages of fertility-control offering legitimate ways for women to avoid what she called “involuntary motherhood.” Moreover, if contraceptives proved not to be foolproof, she saw no reason not to fall back on abortion (if it were “skilled”) and infanticide. Indeed, she explicitly approved of mothers exposing their infants in ancient Sparta and Rome, as well as drowning their girl-infants in contemporary China. She regarded the right to kill their infants as evidence of women’s high status in antiquity, and so she excoriated early Christians for replacing infanticide with orphanages. To make her extremist views palatable, Sanger would often package them in sentimental and religious rhetoric.

These bans do, however, serve important educational objectives by emphasizing the humanity of the unborn.

T2  - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology
AB  - The concept of “brain death” is controversial but widely accepted in practice. Current practice generally attempts to make a determination of death by using neurological criteria alone as a way to show “irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem.” This determination is to be made “in accordance with accepted medical standards” according to the 1981 Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA). Many state statutes are modeled on the UDDA. The apnea test is the final test in many protocols for a person in unresponsive coma of known cause, presumably irreversible, and is considered by some the “sine qua non” for “brain death.” But even some physicians who are in favor of the concept of brain death and vital organ procurement have called it “not defensible.” In this paper we review the apnea test procedure in the context of basic respiratory physiology and ventilator use. We examine its rationale and summarize its flaws. In particular, we bring attention to the recent Nevada statute that mandates use of the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines (AANG) to declare “brain death,” including the use of the apnea test without consent.

While aggregates of cells can have complex properties, they do not show such global integration of function. All living organisms are capable of integration, but the mechanism by which it is accomplished depends on both the nature of the organism itself, on the complexity of the biological niche that it has evolved to occupyand on the stage of development that the organism has attained. The distinction between integration (an intrinsic organismal function) and coordination (a function that is observed inbothorganisms and aggregates of cells) discriminates between human beings and human cells at all stages of life.

important thinkers, describe political structures, interpret modern culture, and
analyze the abortion debate. Sin is, at root, the refusal of human beings to inhabit
these dimensions in their complexity and richness; sin is an artificial narrowing

overemphasized the vertical axis, Marxism the horizontal plane, abortion the role
of individual autonomy. The paradox revealed by dimensional anthropology is
that the pro-choice position is both too big and too small at the same time; it puffs
up the individual to god-like status while shrinking the circumference of moral
concern down to narcissism.

TI  - Cryopreserved Embryos and Dignitas Personae: Another Option?
AU  - Tully, Patrick A.
AB  - Many of the thousands of human embryos currently in cryogenic
storage will sooner or later be discarded, often after being experimented upon.
Others will remain in storage indefinitely, left there by parents who have no plans
either to bring them to term or to offer them for adoption. These facts, coupled
with a commitment to the basic moral equality of all human beings at all stages
of development, generate a pressing question: What should be done for these
embryos whose vital activities have been suspended and whose futures look so
bleak? This paper offers a case that allowing some of these cryogenically stored
embryos to thaw and die, and to dispose of their remains in a manner that reflects
their status, is morally acceptable in that it is consistent with the principles that
many accept as governing the removal of life-sustaining treatment in end-of-life
cases.

Bank see it as an organization dedicated to rebuilding infrastructure
in war-torn nations and to promoting economic progress in the
developing world. And while it is true that the Bank does devote
an enormous amount of its financial resources to the traditional
areas of economic development, it has also devoted a very large
portion of these resources towards population control programs
over the last few decades. These programs ultimately provide
money for sterilization operations, and the distribution of
contraceptives all around the world. This paper examines how for
decades the Bank has funded aggressive population control
programs in the developing world; and how extensive the Bank’s
support for these programs has been.

TI  - Toward a More Pro-life Campus: Insights from Attitude Research
AU  - DiFonzo, Nicholas
T2  - The Forum
AB  - Attitude research applied to pro-life persuasion provides a fruitful framework that includes cognitive, motivational, and relational/network approaches to attitude change. The pro-life aim of persuasion, empowerment to think more deliberatively, is contrasted with propaganda, which reduces critical faculties. Cognitive research shows that the perceived outcomes of making abortion illegal carry important associated subjective likelihoods and value judgments, and that pro-life attitude shifts occur simply by contesting pro-choice claims with novel challenges. Motivational approaches show that defensiveness will hinder persuasion attempts, but these may possibly be reduced through affirmation of the sense of self. Relational and network perspectives show that attitudes are socially infectious, and people are embedded in clumpy-segregated echo-chambers that produce extreme positions. Using this framework, pro-lifers can have more influence through an outreach-oriented mindset by forming relationships within targeted clusters, reducing defensiveness, and challenging pro-choice ideas with novel information using a framework of outcome likelihoods and value-judgments.

AB  - nce the abortion decisions of 1973, there has been a
change in medical ethics in which the “presumption for life” has been
replaced by the “quality of life” ethic. A number of legislative and
legal events have occurred in America that have brought about this
major change in attitude and value regarding the right to life in
medical decision-making. One of the results has been an increased use
of euthanasia, especially for older persons and those with disabilities.
The “Will to Live” is an advance directive that calls for a presumption
in favor of life. It is designed to prevent patients from becoming
victims of our growing “culture of death.”

TI  - The Embryo as Person
AU  - O'Rourke, Kevin
AB  - In order to determine the human rights of the embryo, we must first determine whether or not it is a person. Certainly, it does not look like a person when its life begins, or in the first stages of it existence. But in its genetic makeup, it has the active potency that enables it to develop the characteristics that we associate with personhood. The modern concept of personhood, following the thought of John Locke, focuses upon consciousness as the essence of personhood. Modern philosophers believe that consciousness is acquired over time, and is at times latent. Thus the concept of potency is not foreign to modern thought concerning personhood. There are many bioethicists who admit that the embryo or zygote is a living being, but they are not willing to affirm that it is a human being at the time of its formation. An analysis of their arguments results in an affirmation that the embryo is a person in the sense indicated above. While the Church has not stated definitely that the embryo is a human person, it has affirmed the need to respect it as such. Maintaining that human life begins at fertilization does not imply that human life is an absolute good.

However, the effects of some of the laws that received constitutional protection in the Supreme Court’s Casey vs. Planned Parenthood decision, including informed consent laws and waiting periods, have only received scant attention. In this study I remedy this shortcoming by examining the effects of a variety of state level pro-life laws over a comprehensive dataset that spans fifteen years. I find that the enactment of parental involvement laws, public funding restrictions, partial-birth abortion bans, and informed consent laws are all correlated with declines in the incidence of abortion.

AB  - Postmodernism is typically thought to be problematic in the explication of traditional logics embracing the dignity of human life. Nonetheless, it is possible and useful to use postmodern rhetorical techniques to observe the deficiencies of liberal feminism=s failure to account for female life. The recent case of Terri Schiavo has highlighted the rhetorical limitations of traditional feminism. The failure of the feminist left to comment on Schiavo=s vulnerability and worth as a woman exposes a strategic failure of this movement=s alleged representation of women=s interests. This paper seeks to broadly explore the strategic absences of feminist text in articulating Awomen=s interests.@ This study examines four contemporary failures of feminist critique: sex- selection abortion, Taliban degradation of women, the dehumanization of Terri Schiavo, and the recent murder of Theo Van Gogh. The purpose of this technique is to demonstrate how contemporary techniques of study like postmodernism can ironically enable a broader and more stable reality of dignity for human lifeBparticularly for women.

TI  - Attitudes, Intentions, and Ethical Stance of Advanced Practice Nursing Students toward Abortion Provision: Part One - Quantitative Findings
AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AB  - The availability of pre-implantation abortion pills has increased the probability that advanced practice nurses (i.e., nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives) will be instrumental in providing abortion services in the United States. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the attitudes, intentions, and ethical stance of advanced practice nursing students towards the provision of abortion services. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 53 advanced practice nursing students at a private Midwestern Catholic university. A multi-item abortion attitude survey was administered to students in three required courses. The survey included a section on ethical principles and open-ended questions on abortion attitudes. The nursing students were either in a woman-related specialty, pediatrics, or in general adult nursing; most were between the ages of 24-29 (60.5%); and most (66.0%) were Roman Catholic. A majority (61.5%) did not feel that abortion should be available under any circumstance. However, 54% felt that advanced practice nurses should be able to provide abortion services. Few (7.7%) plan on incorporating abortion into their practices but 74.4% would refer for abortion services. The most frequent reasons for not willing to provide abortion were: (1) out of scope of practice (53.8%), (2) religious beliefs (59.0%), and (3) personal values (64.1%). The respondents for most part indicated either Sacred Life (43.6%) or Human Life/Utilitarian (48.7%) as their ethical stance. The Human Life/Utilitarian students had a significantly higher willingness to provide abortion services than Sacred Life students (p < 0.05). Although the majority of advanced practice nursing students did not intend to provide abortion services, most were open to referring for abortion services and saw abortion as a personal right.

The essay continues with a summary of the new Compendium=s treatment of abortion; marriage and procreation; war, legitimate defense and capital punishment; and the responsibility of Catholics in the political arena. In the final analysis, the new Compendium highlights the right to life from the moment of conception as Athe first among all rights and the condition for all other rights of the person.@ The Catholic pro-life teaching, therefore, is an essential and foundational aspect of the Church=s social doctrine.

He was put down not only for his actions on behalf of Bland, but also for his previous non-violent Rescues at abortion clinics. The disparagement of Father Morrow in 1993 goes a long way to explain why the Catholic resistance to the Culture of Death in Britain has been so ineffectual.

The first part of the essay grounds and develops the distinction between two moments of abortion, one the inner state of the agent of abortion from the perspective of morality, the other the injustice toward the victim. Each respective moment represents a distinct goal; and each goal requires its own specific methods for its realization. Changing hearts and minds of the moral agents requires a method of dialogue, persuasion, education; defending the innocent victim against unjust aggression requires the use of power and force. The second part of the essay analyzes some of the confusions that have led to the substitution of dialogue for action and the consequences of this substitution.

TI  - Ensoulment Problems
AU  - Reimers, Adrian J
AB  - One of the most frequently disputed questions in the contemporary abortion controversy concerns the moment of ensoulment, the moment at which the fetus ceases to be simply a living organism and becomes a human person. Although some commentators allege that Thomas Aquinas, among others, held to a theory of delayed ensoulment, the real issue for modern thinkers is the moment (if there is such) of the onset of conscious personhood. Identifying personhood with self-consciousness, autonomy, and evident rationality, many contemporary thinkers maintain that the fetusCand indeed the newborn infantCalthough human, does not qualify as a person. This conception of person is ideally suited for a utilitarian ethics, whose premises are founded in consciousness. After showing how Aquinas=s problem was quite different from the modern version, this article rejects the characterization of the person in terms of consciousness, arguing instead that transcendence toward the good in truth is the distinctively human. All human beings except the most immature and badly injured manifest this transcendence, if only to a limited extent. This transcendence cannot be attributed to any mechanical or physical system, but requires an immaterial seat in the human subject. An immaterial principle, or soul, is required to account for this transcendence. The paper concludes with a short ethical reflection on inappropriateness of the utilitarian response to the very immature and the physically or mentally compromised.

Of the world she asks merely that civil society rise above the level of barbarism and not engage in such utilitarian homicides as abortion, euthanasia and destruction of embryos. To affirm life as good, pains as much as pleasures, is one pivot of biblical religion (the other is history). Following Edward Hobbs, the chief pains come as exposure (when I can be seen by the world for what I am), limitation (when my plans and desires are frustrated), and need (when other people make demands on my time and resources). The result is a process of conversion of life, in which I am by stages transformed into blessing all of life, even the parts that I had formerly rejected as evil.

It places abortion in the context of decisions about pregnancy and birth. Empirical work has focused on the effects of policy on abortion demand, the economic effects of abortion on women, and the characteristics of those aborted. Few researchers have explored the supply side of abortion.

TI  - Statutory Responses to “Wrongful Birth” and “Wrongful Life” Actions
AU  - Duncan, William C
AB  - As a result of advances in medical technology and the legality of the practice of abortion, a new class of tort actions has developed. Named “wrongful birth” or “wrongful life” actions, they require a plaintiff to argue that but for the negligence of a doctor or medical personnel, a child would have been aborted. A number of states now recognize such actions, but a handful of states have specifically rejected the actions. This article describes the law of this handful of states, describing legislative responses to the wrongful life and birth actions and court judgements assessing challenges to these laws. From the description, it then outlines four major public policy purposes advanced by laws that prohibit the new actions: (1) decreasing medical costs, (2) discouraging abortion, (3) creating a barrier to eugenic campaigns, and (4) defending the sanctity of life.

TI  - Reflections on the Terri Schindler-Schiavo Controversy:
AU  - Myers, Richard S.
T2  - Catholic Social Science Review
AB  - Despite the enormous attention it received, the Terri Schindler-Schiavo litigation is not legally significant. The litigation involved the application of a fairly wellsettled legal framework. This framework permitted, however, an unjust result. The controversy over Terri’s fate has, though, helped to focus attention on a consensus that is in need of re-examination. This paper explores the lessons that ought to be learned from the Terri SchindlerSchiavo litigation. After briefly discussing the basic facts and the complex litigation history, the paper considers the relevant federal constitutional and Florida law. The paper then critiques Florida law and explains the legal and moral considerations that ought to inform the re-examination that is so sorely needed. The most important effort needed is to restore the sanctity of life ethic.

TI  - What Happens to the Victims of Compromise Abortion Laws?
AU  - Fedoryka, Damian P
AB  - The essay addresses the problem of the socalled “compromise laws” that are favored by a large and respectable segment of the pro-life community. The notion of toleration operative here is problematic since it implicitly includes acts of murder that are legislatively affirmed as rights even though heavily regulated to reduce their incidence. The author argues that one reason for this form of “toleration” is the failure to distinguish in every abortion the moment of morality from the moment of justice. The difference between the finality of moral and legal prohibitions establishes the basis for determining whether or not the state has the competence to legislate morality. The immorality of a behavior that has moral consequences for the agent of the act is irrelevant and an improper reason for legislation. Of direct relevance is the right to or the legitimate ownership of one’s life. It is not something that can be regulated or restricted. Compromise laws do precisely that and are therefore intrinsically unjust. Their appeal lies in the fact that a larger number of unborn lives could be saved due to the regulation of abortion. But exchanging the lives of the few in order to gain an advantage for the “more” is intrinsically unjust since the legislator has no right to give up in a compromise law what belongs not to him but to the victim of injustice. Any “compromise law” that regulates abortions and thereby achieves a reduction in their number is intrinsically unjust even though it effects a greater good.

TI  - Abortion, Thinking Americans, and Judicial Politics
AU  - Rychlak, Ronald J
AB  - Many pro-life arguments are emotional, based on a form of theology, if not religion itself. These arguments have failed to persuade those Americans who have come to terms with legal abortion. The author of this paper argues that these “thinking” Americans must and can be persuaded by the logic of the pro-life case. The author sets forth the history of abortion law in the U.S. from the Revolutionary War to the current abortionon-demand society. He shows that modern abortion law is terribly inconsistent with other aspects of American jurisprudence because it is based on false historical claims, incorrect assertions about science, improper logic, and deceptive lawyering. He concludes by reviewing the current political situation and offering a plan of action on how pro-life forces can capitalize on the logic of their argument, the inconsistencies of the pro-choice movement, and the political will of the nation in order to help protect the most vulnerable members of society.

TI  - Stealing Fire from the Sky: Transvaluating Religion in the Service of Abortion
AU  - Gardiner, Anne Barbeau
AB  - In the 1980s, the advocates of abortion pleaded for “nuance” from leaders of traditional religions, but nowadays they assert without any nuance at all that abortion is a “traditional” and “sacred right” in all the world’s major religions. They argue that it therefore amounts to persecution, a violation of religious liberty, to restrict women’s access to abortion. This new attempt to seize the high moral and religious ground from the defenders of unborn life is bold in the extreme, but ultimately incoherent and unpersuasive. For the claim that abortion is “sacred” in the world’s religions is just not supported by the facts that are brought forward. Indeed, the advocates of abortion are themselves obliged to admit that Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions will all have to be changed and adapted to contemporary mores in order to serve the cause of untrammeled abortion.

TI  - Does Personhood Begin with Conscious Desires?
AU  - Kaczor, Christopher
AB  - David Boonin’s A Defense of Abortion (2003) argues that without present desires of some kind a being cannot have the right to life. Since desires presuppose brain development of at least 25-32 weeks, abortion prior to this time does not kill a being with a right to live. This paper questions Boonin’s thesis by arguing that (1) this criterion is under-inclusive, for it excludes beings that clearly are persons, (2) this conception is incompatible with inalienable rights, and thus cannot succeed, as Boonin hopes, on grounds that are already accepted by those that are pro-life, (3) this account does not exclude other grounds for thinking that killing is wrong, grounds that could include beings without desires, (4) this analysis cannot secure that people have equal rights to life, and (5) this justification of the right to life does not exclude infanticide.

TI  - Abortion and Parental Obligation
AU  - Peach, Andrew J
AB  - Although it has received comparatively little attention in the literature, the question of what exactly grounds a parent’s obligation to his or her offspring is of central importance to the abortion debate. This essay argues that the true ground of such obligations lies in the biological bond that exists between parents and children, a bond that is forged at conception but that the defender of abortion-on-demand can provide no reasonable grounds for these obligations. Through an investigation of the nature of obligations in general, this essay shows that neither “choice,” nor the alleged onset of “personhood,” nor the birth of a child can reasonably be said to mark the onset or be the ground of such duties. However attractive the notion of “planned parenthood” may be, the ethical voluntarism of the pro-choice movement effectively does away with parental obligations and, to that extent, does away with the family.

AB  - After discussing Dr. Peach’s demolition of the proabortionist identification of choice as the ground of parental obligation, this paper argues that his identification of biological relatedness as that ground needs further development. For biological relatedness does not ground parental obligations in cases of in vitro fertilization, since the lab technician need not obtain eggs and sperm from living humans. In such cases, it is the lab technician who causes the conception. Hence, I argue that reproductive causality, or “child-making,” is the true source of parental obligation.

AB  - There are two basic understandings of what it means to be human and a person, and these two concepts underlie two diametrically opposed views on the discipline and practice of medicine, namely, Hippocratic Medicine and the New Medicine. This paper briefly shows some of the differences between these two approaches in regard to understanding death, dying, suicide and despair, euthanasia, killing and letting die, ordinary and extraordinary care, physician-assisted suicide, advanced directives and living wills, persistent vegetative state, brain and brainstem death, and terminal sedation. A gradual change from the Hippocratic to a “new” model of disease underlies many of the conflicts in ethical and moral decision making in our time.

AU  - Klaus, Hanna
AB  - In response to a request by Barr Laboratories to market their “emergency contraceptive” Plan B across the counter, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held a public hearing. Objections to the proposal included: (1) A considerable increase in tubal pregnancies following ingestion of Plan B was found in U.K., prompting a warning to physicians. Lack of medical supervision when providing this drug is the height of medical irresponsibility. (2) Following a highly publicized trial of dispensing the drug without a prescription but only counseling by pharmacists in five states, the rate of the most common sexually transmitted diseases increased by 20%. (3) The availability of a “fall back” pill will only increase sexual irresponsibility, especially by teens. (4) It will also provide an easy means to make sure that a perpetrator of sexual assault will not become liable for child support. (5) When taken during the fertile window of the cycle, the pill may act as an abortifacient rather than as a means to prevent conception. (6) The “fertile window” is six days long; its start and finish can be determined by teaching women to understand their cervical mucus patterns. Yet the manufacturers offer the drug for use at any time and charge the same amount for two pills that they charge for a month’s supply of oral contraceptives, although the pills could only have a possible application for one fourth of the cycle.

TI  - The Use of Force in a Culture of Death
AU  - Fedoryka, Damian P
AB  - The present essay addresses the status of a debate in which the pro-choice side has co-opted and determined the use of language in such a way that tips the debate by the definition of terms in favor of the pro-choice position. An uncritical engagement in such debate results in the impotence of the pro-life movement. One such term is “violence,” which is simply defined as the use of force in opposition to some subjective claim. The thesis of the essay is that violence is the unjust use of force and that therefore it is the context of justice that establishes the proper meaning of such terms as “force” and “rights.” The foundation of rights is human existence received as a gift that calls for reciprocity in self-giving. The latter necessarily presupposes selfpossession or ownership of one’s own being. Legitimate selfpossession justifies the use of force in keeping what is one’s own over against someone who would appropriate it. This metaphysical status of self-possession is the objective foundation for both human dignity and the subjective experience of it. It explains both the possibility of victimhood and of aggression. It also explains the fact that an unjust aggressor will experience the just use of force in defense of the victim as a violation of his own (the aggressor’s) dignity. This experience of violated human dignity plays a fundamental role in the debate and is appealed to against any presumptive divine or human sovereignty that would hinder the claim to what one wants, in this case, the abortion. The author argues that such an appeal to the subjective experience of a “violated” desire has no probative force against human rights as grounded in the transcendent sovereignty of God.

TI  - Abortion and Family Formation: Circumstance or Culture?
AU  - Sullins, D Paul
AB  - Research using opinion surveys and abortion-patient censuses has found that opinion and practice on abortion often appear incongruent. This is generally attributed to circumstantial pressures that motivate women to make an atypical choice, conceived in terms of rational utility; but it may also be due to the fact that the socio-cultural values of women having abortions are not representative of their opinion group. Taking participation in marriage and family formation behavior as indicators of traditional cultural values, I examine fertility data from the National Survey of Family Growth (N=10,847) in order to determine whether women having abortions differ significantly in their opinions regarding such behaviors from those not having abortions. I find that women having abortions are twice as likely never to marry, 37% more likely to divorce, have (on average) twice as many lifetime sexual partners and three times as many partners before marriage, have fewer children, and experience both earlier sexual onset and later marriage. Having successive abortions or abortions on different pregnancies affects these differences not at all or only slightly. I argue that these differences suggest that abortion decisions stem in large part from diverse sociocultural values rather than from circumstantial concessions.

AU  - Fehring, Richard J
AU  - McGraw, Elizabeth
AB  - Over 30 years ago the founders of the Christian Family Movement (CFM), a worldwide Catholic family action group, conducted a survey to investigate the marital effects of practicing “rhythm.” Their final report indicated that many participants felt that periodic abstinence was harmful to their marriage and caused spiritual and religious distress. The CFM survey results were thought to have been influential in convincing the 1966 Papal Birth Control Commission to recommend a change in church teaching. The purpose of this paper is to report a re-analysis of the 1966 archived data (in the light of the Papal Encyclical Humane Vitae–On the Regulation of Birth) and to compare that study with responses from married couples using modern methods of NFP, i.e., methods that purport to be more effective and to have fewer days of periodic abstinence. This paper will provide an examination of the original study within its historical context and report on the responses relating to spirituality from the 1966 couples in comparison with couples currently practicing periodic abstinence through the Billings Ovulation Method.

TI  - Does Premature Intercourse Delay Psychological Maturation? An Analysis of Outcome Data of the 1998-99 Teen STAR Program
AU  - Klaus, Hanna
AB  - The efficacy of the Teen STAR Program for undergirding virginity and/or facilitating a return to chastity has been reported previously. We now correlate behavioral outcome with program components of the 199899 cohorts. There were 48 French, 23 Swiss and 234 U.S. females aged 11-17 who followed the 8-month program, which joins experiential learning of fertility signs to a developmental didactic curriculum that_includes regular teacher-student interviews; there were also 371 males aged 11-16 who followed a parallel program. A_ previously validated Likert-type_ 18-item questionnaire identified demographics, participants’ expectations for future abstinence,_ control of their emotions,_ empathy in dealing with others, overall helpfulness of the program, frequency of topical discussions with parents and friends,_ age at first intercourse, time of_ last intercourse, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and_ reasons for abstinence._ Reasons for abstinence offered insight into the locus of control.

TI  - ADOPTION: NOT AN EASY OPTION
AU  - LaMonica, Teresa
AB  - ADOPTION IS A VIABLE OPTION in our society today but one that holds lasting consequences for all those involved in the adoption triad: birth parents, adoptive parents, and the adoptee. One should not underestimate its effect on any of these parties. Like organ transplants, there are definite benefits for the recipient but a high cost to the donor. The act of adoption always exacts a cost from someone. Even in the best scenarios, where there is much preparation and support, there is a process of grieving that must be worked through for all those involved. This article will attempt to dispel some of the commonly held myths about adoption and look at the process through the perspective of each member of the adoption triad.
